# Dev Docs documentation

Welcome to the documentation of the Dev Docs site!

Answer to yourself:

## Q: I want to write a documentation article for the Dev Docs site

A:

Read the [Writing articles for Dev Docs](./writing-articles.md)
documentation and head on to the [src/docs/](../src/docs) directory.

If you're unsure under which category the article should go, have a look
at the
[Docs site structure Whimsical board](https://whimsical.com/flex-docs-PEaMXJE9MB3vHXtP2VsgFX)

## Q: I want to change some UI text on the Dev Docs site

A:

All the UI texts are in [src/ui-texts.json](../src/ui-texts.json). Make
a PR with the change and check the preview as instructed in
[Making a PR and previewing the content](./writing-articles.md#making-a-pr-and-previewing-the-content).

## Q: I want to improve image quality

A:

To save bandwith, we have set the image quality to 85, which is what
Google recommends. Furthermore, images are shown as 635px wide. This
means that images you see are shrinked to that size. This process of
compressing and shrinking has a tendency to bleed the colors on sharp
edges. Therefore, it's recommended that you manually resize your images
to 635 pixels wide - you can use tool of your choice: Preview,
Pixelmator, Photoshop, etc.

## Q: I want to develop the Dev Docs site

A:

To understand how the project works, what technologies are in use, see
the [Dev Docs overview](./overview.md) documentation.

To start coding, read the
[Dev Docs coding conventions](./coding-conventions.md) to understand the
philosophy of why and how things are done in a certain way.

## Q: I want to add a terminal recording

Check
[How to record terminal session](./how-to-record-terminal-session.md).
