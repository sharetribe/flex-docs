You can set your marketplace commission in
[the Commission page of your Console account](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/a/transactions/commission/).
The commission that you set will always be a percentage of the
transaction total.

### Example

Letâ€™s assume that you set a commission of 10% on your marketplace. If
the seller lists the item for $100, and the buyer pays the $100 for the
listing. Your commission will be $10. The seller would get $90 and you
would get \$10 (minus any Stripe fees).
