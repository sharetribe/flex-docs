To set your marketplace commission, go to **Build**. On the page, click on the **Content** tab, and select **Commission**. On this page, input your **Provider Commission (%)** and **Save Changes**.

### Example
Letâ€™s assume that you set a commission of 10% on your marketplace. If the seller lists the item for $100, and the buyer pays the $100 for the listing. The marketplace gets $10, and the seller gets $90. 

This is also known as the seller commission.
