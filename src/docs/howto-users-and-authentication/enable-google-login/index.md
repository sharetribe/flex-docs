**Note, that Google login requires ftw-daily version
[6.5.0](https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily/releases/tag/v6.5.0) or
ftw-hourly version
[8.5.0](https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-hourly/releases/tag/v8.5.0).**

<extrainfo title="Updating from upstream not an option?">

Has your marketplace UI application diverged from ftw-daily or
ftw-hourly so much that pulling upstream updates to enable Google login
is not a feasible option? In that case, take a look at the following
change sets in ftw-daily for reference on how to implement Google login
in the front end:

- [Facebook login changes](https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily/pull/1366)
  (contains many updates regarding social logins in general)
- [Google login changes](https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily/pull/1376)

</extrainfo>

Enabling Google login consists of three main steps:

- **Create a Google Sign-In Project** Google Sign-In Project is what
  connects your marketplace to Google and let's Google know that users
  from your marketplace are allowed to authenticate themselves using the
  Google Sign-In.
- **Create an identity provider client in Flex Console** Identity
  provider (IdP) client is what let's Flex know that the users of your
  marketplace are allowed to use the Google Sign-In Project you created
  to log into your marketplace.
- **Configure FTW** A few attributes from the Sign-In Project will need
  to be configured to FTW so that FTW can perform the login flow via
  Google.

## Configure the Google Sign-In Project

_Note, that Google's interface is subject to change. If you encounter
any inconsistencies with this step-by-step guide, please contact
Sharetribe's Support team and we will be happy to assist._

First thing to do is to create a Google Sign-In project for your
marketplace by following these steps:

### Create and set up a Google Sign-In Project

1. Go to https://console.developers.google.com/
2. Log in with your Google account (you may have to register as a
   developer if you don't have a Google developer account already).
3. Click the "Select a project" button on the top bar.
4. When the pop-up opens click the "New project" button on the top right
   corner.
5. Name your Project (for example your marketplace name) and click
   "Create".
6. Go to the "OAuth consent screen" page e.g. from the left side menu.
7. Once there, select "External" as a User type and click "Create".
8. Fill in at least the required fields in this next page. You need to
   add e.g the name and user support email for your app.
9. From the left sidebar go to the "Credentials" page.
10. Click "+ Create credentials" from the top of the page.
11. Select "OAuth Client ID"
12. Application type is "Web application". You can give it any name.
13. In "Authorized JavaScript origins", add your full marketplace's URL
    with https and possibly www or the subdomain, without the trailing
    slash, e.g. "https://www.example.com", "https://example.com", or
    "https://something.example.com".
14. In the "Authorized redirect URIs", add your marketplace address
    followed by `/api/auth/google/callback`.
15. Click "Create".

## Configure an identity provider client in Console

Now that your Google Sign-In project is all set up, a corresponding
_identity provider client_ will need to be configured for your
marketplace. This will tell Flex that your users will be allowed to log
into your marketplace using the Google Sign-In you just created. The
information stored in an IdP client is used to verify a token obtained
from Google when a user logs in.

An identity provider client can be configure with the following steps:

1. Go to
   [Social logins & SSO in Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/social-logins-and-sso).
2. Under _Identity provider clients_ click "+ Add new".
3. Set "Client name". This can be anything you choose, for example,
   "Google login".
4. Under "Select identity provider", pick "Google".
5. Set the _Client ID_. This value is the Client ID from your Google
   Sign-In project. You can see the value under _Credentials > OAuth 2.0
   client IDs_. Make sure you have the project you just created selected
   from the top bar in Google developer console. In case you have
   multiple clients configured in Google Sign-In, use the client ID of
   your _Web application_ client here. See step 6. for more information.

The IdP client config should now look something like this:

![Add Google identity provider client](add-google-idp-client.png 'Add Google identity provider client')

6. If you have more than one client configured in your Google Sign-In
   project, mobile clients for example, add the additional client IDs to
   the same identity provider client under "Trusted client IDs" by
   clicking "+ Add new trusted client". In case you are using two
   distinct Google Sign-In projects, configure those as distinct clients
   in Console but always bundle all the client IDs of a single project
   into one identity provider client in Flex Console.
7. Click "Add client" and your identity provider client is ready.

## Configure FTW

Last step to enabling Google login is to configure FTW with the values
that you used to add an identity provider client in Console. Add the
following environment variables to FTW:

- **`REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`** The Client ID of your Google Sing-In.
  Corresponds to _client ID_ of the identity provider client in Console.
- **`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`** The Client Secret of your Google Sign-In.

For more information on FTW environment variables, see the
[FTW Environment configuration variables](/ftw/ftw-env/) article.

That is it. Setting these environment variables will make FTW render the
Google login button in signup and login forms.
