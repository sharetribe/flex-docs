## What is Zapier and why should you use it?
Your Flex marketplace is built on top of APIs, which makes it possible for your marketplace app to talk to other web applications.  Building third-party integrations is a great way to bring new features to your marketplace, but until now, it still required advanced coding skills to connect two apps. 

With Zapier, you can connect your Flex marketplace with more than 3,000 other web apps with just a few clicks. Once you’ve created a Zapier account and connected your Flex marketplace account, you can use several events in your marketplace as a trigger for actions in other apps. A new booking can trigger the sending of a text message with Twilio. A new user sign-up can set into action a campaign of drip emails in Mailchimp. A new listing can be automatically posted to any of your marketplace’s social accounts. And so much 
more. 


## Connecting Zapier to Flex

To take Zapier into use and connect it to Flex, you need:
An account at Zapier. There is a free trial, but eventually, based on your usage, you may need a paid plan at Zapier.
A Client ID and a Client Secret for the Integration API,  which you need to authorize Zapier to connect to your Flex account. You can create a Client ID and a Client Secret by adding a new application in Console > Build > Applications.
An account for each third-party app you’d like to connect with.
