The following configuration variables can be set to control the Flex
template app behaviour. Most of them have defaults that work for
development environment. For production deploys most should be set.

## Variables

- **`REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`**

  See the
  [How to set up Mapbox for FTW](/ftw/how-to-set-up-mapbox-for-ftw/)
  guide for more information.

  Your application's client ID. You can get this from
  [Flex Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/applications).

- **`SHARETRIBE_SDK_CLIENT_SECRET`**

  Your application's client secret. It's related to client ID and used
  for privileged transitions from server side. You can get this from
  [Flex Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/applications).

- **`REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`**

  Stripe publishable API key for generating tokens with Stripe API. Use
  test key (prefix `pk_test_`) for development. The secret key needs to
  be added to Flex Console.

  example: USD, EUR, CAD, AUD, etc.

  Canonical root url of the marketplace. Needed for social media
  sharing, SEO optimization, and social logins. Note, that the value
  should not include a trailing slash.

- **`NODE_ENV`**

  Node env. Use 'development' for development and 'production' for
  production.

- **`PORT`**

  Port for server to accept connections.

- **`REACT_APP_ENV`**

  to differentiate envs in logging.

  App secret of a Facebook App when Facebook login is used.

> **NOTE**: FTW templates are built on top of Create React App (CRA).
> CRA uses WebpackDevServer for providing Hot Module Reloading feature.
> In some environments, WebpackDevServer might need some extra
> configurations. You should also check CRA's advanced configurations if
> you experience problems with socket ports.

## Defining configuration

When the app is started locally with `yarn run dev` or
`yarn run dev-server`, you can set environment variables by using the
(gitignored) `.env` file. You can edit the basic variables via
`yarn run config` or by editing directly the `.env` file. Some variables
can be edited only in the .env file. The repository contains a template
file `.env-template` with default configuration.

In production, it's recommended that you set the configuration via env
variables and do not deploy an `.env` file. The client application will
only be packaged with env variables that start with `REACT_APP`. This
way server secrets don't end up in client bundles.

**With deploys note that the configuration options are bundled in the
client package at build time.** The configuration of the build
environment must match run environment for things to work consistently.
To apply changes to configuration values client bundle must be rebuilt.
Just restarting the server is not enough.
