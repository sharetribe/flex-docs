In 2022-09, Flex introduces a headless CMS-like feature to create static
pages in Flex. Initially, the feature allows operators to modify their
landing pages without code. Going forward, it will be possible to create
new pages as well.

## Content modeling in Flex

When managing content, it is useful to distinguish content modeling from
content. **Content modeling** means the different elements that can
comprise e.g. a single page â€“ headings, text blocks, buttons, images and
so forth. A single content model that features a heading, a text block,
an image and a button, can be used to create several different pages
with different **content**.

In Flex, the content modeling is done for you. Each **page** can have
several **sections**, which in turn can have several **blocks**.
Depending on which kinds of sections and blocks you choose for your
page, you can build a wide range of content patterns.

### Sections

Flex has X default content sections that you can select for your page.
All sections have a title, an ingress, and a button for a call to
action.

#### Article

Article sections are great for prose text. If your content is longer,
you can add blocks with different levels of headings and text
paragraphs. The blocks are displayed in a column one after the other, as
if on a blog page.

#### Columns

Columns sections divide the blocks within the section into pre-defined
columns, and the operator can decide the number of columns between 1-4.
The columns pattern is great for featuring specific options in parallel,
whether they are benefits or testimonials or featured locations.

#### Features

Features sections, by default, show blocks of visual and text content so
that the block contents are on a single row, alternating the order, and
different blocks are in a column. As with all content sections, the
designer of your website can make changes as to how exactly the blocks
get displayed on the page.

### Blocks

Currently, Flex has a single type of block that you can add to any
section. The block contains a title, and you can determine the level of
the title (page title, section title, section subtitle). A block can
also have text content and a button.

Block text content can be modified with Markdown. This allows the
content creator to use even more fine-grained editing, including italics
and bolding, subheadings, links, and code snippets.

## Content delivery

Once the page has been created, it is delivered as an
[asset](/references/assets) to the client application. For the landing
page, the asset being modified in Flex is `content/landing-page.js`.
Assets can be fetched by the latest version, or a specific version.

## Content layout

Content modeling does not, by default, contain information how the
content should be laid out in the client application. The FTW templates
do have components corresponding to the different content sections.
However, the Flex content management assets can be used in any client
application, and even in the FTW templates you have full freedom as to
how the different sections get displayed. This means that even with the
pre-defined options, you can create a page setup that is entirely your
own.
