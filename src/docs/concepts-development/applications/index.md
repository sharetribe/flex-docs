  Flex Applications are the entities that authenticate to and access the

In Flex, accessing the
[Marketplace API or the Integration API](/concepts-api-sdk/marketplace-api-integration-api/)
starts with creating an
[_application_](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/applications). Each
application has the necessary credentials (client ID and optional client
secret) that are used to
[authenticate](/concepts-api-sdk/authentication-api/) your application
to the Flex APIs.

Applications come in two types: Marketplace API applications and
Integration API applications. Marketplace API applications have only a
client ID, while Integration API applications have both a client ID and
a client secret. As a general rule, the client ID can be considered
public information, while the client secret must always be kept secure.

## Best practices

- Create a separate application for each of your systems that access the
  Flex APIs. For example, if you have a web and a mobile app, create two
  separate Marketplace API applications.
- **IMPORTANT** Always keep your Integration API application's client
  secret secure. Never expose it in a untrusted device or application,
  such as end users' browsers or mobile apps.
- Name your applications so that it is easier for you to recognize how
  each one is used. For instance, use names like "Web UI", "iOS mobile
  app", "reporting", "mailing list integration", etc.
