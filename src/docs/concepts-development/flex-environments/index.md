  What are Flex environments and the differences the three types have.
published: true

Flex environments are instances of your own marketplace, but with
different functions. When you first create a Flex account, you have two
environments: Demo and Development. When you are ready to go live, we
will create you a third environment: Production.

The environment can be changed from the dropdown in the left corner of
the topbar. Those who have access to multiple organizations can see the
organization dropdown on the right.

Organization and environment are terms that are used to communicate what
Flex marketplace you are looking at in Console.

> **Organization**: An entity that is created when you first create an
> account. This is where you can invite other admin users to work with.
> An organization can include multiple environments for different
> purposes, but only one live environment which is called production.

> **Environment**: A marketplace instance within your organization which
> can be created for different purposes. There are three different types
> of environments: demo, development and production. You can access them
> all with the same Flex account.

## Environment types

### Demo environment

The Demo environment is created for you for trying out Flex marketplace
functionality. The demo environment includes a fully working marketplace
front, Saunatime, that can be accessed from the Home page.

In this environment, you can explore the connection between the
marketplace front the clients will be using, and Console which will work
as your admin panel. Use Saunatime marketplace to create new users and
listings, and try out how the transactions work. You can view and manage
the activity in Console.

### Development environment

Development environment is for development and testing purposes. This is
where building your marketplace happens and where you can test the build
functionalities in peace by using test users and
[test credit cards with Stripe](/how-to/set-up-and-use-stripe/).

Even after launch you can continue building new features in the
development environment without causing disruptions to your live
marketplace. Note that you should not onboard real users or listings to
the development environment, as they cannot be moved into the production
environment.

### Production environment

Production environment is where the business happens: here you can
onboard your real customers and listings and your customers can make
real money transactions.

When the necessary development has been done and your marketplace is
ready for onboarding real users, you can initiate the production
environment setup from Console. This is also the point when you start
paying the Flex subscriptions (see more information about
[Flex pricing](https://www.sharetribe.com/products/flex/#pricing)).
