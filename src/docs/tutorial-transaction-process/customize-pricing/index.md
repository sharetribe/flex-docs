## Store cleaning fee into listing

Pricing can be based on a lot of variables but one practical way to
build it is to base it on information stored as extended data in
listings. In this example, we are using listing's public data to store
information about the cleaning fee. We start by doing some changes to
**EditListingPricingPanel** in _EditListingWizard_.

```shell
└── src
    └── components
        └── EditListingPricingPanel
            └── EditListingPricingPanel.js
```

Here we will only list the required changes. See the
[Add extended data to listing entity tutorial](/tutorial-extended-data/add-extended-data/)
for step-by-step instructions on how to add public data field for
listing.

### Save to public data

In _EditListingPricingPanel_, we need to edit the _onSubmit_ function to
save the new public data field called **cleaningFee**. Because we are
using _FieldCurrencyInput_ component in this example as the input of
choice, the _cleaningFee_ variable will be Money object when we get that
from the submitted _values_. Money object can't be used directly as
public data so we need to create a JSON object with keys **amount** and
**currency** and use it in the underlying API call.

> **Note:** _price_ attribute is one of the listing's default attributes
> so it's passed to Marketplace API directly unlike the new public data
> _cleaningFee_ which needs to be under the _publicData_ key.

```jsx
onSubmit={values => {
  const { price, cleaningFee = null } = values;

  const updatedValues = {
    price,
    publicData: {
      cleaningFee: { amount: cleaningFee.amount, currency: cleaningFee.currency },
    },
  };
  onSubmit(updatedValues);
}}
```

### Initialize the form

Next we want to pass inital values for _price_ and _cleaningFee_. For
this we need to get the _cleaningFee_ from listing attributes under the
_publicData_ key. Also, because _FieldCurrencyInput_ expects the value
to be Money object we need to convert the value we get from Marketplace
API back to instance of Money.

```jsx
const { price, publicData } = currentListing.attributes;
const cleaningFee =
  publicData && publicData.cleaningFee ? publicData.cleaningFee : null;

const cleaningFeeAsMoney = cleaningFee
  ? new Money(cleaningFee.amount, cleaningFee.currency)
  : null;

const initialValues = { price, cleaningFee: cleaningFeeAsMoney };
```

Now pass the whole `initialValues` map in the corresponding prop to
_EditListingPricingForm_.

### Add input component

We want to be able to save the amount of listing's cleaning fee so we
add new _FieldCurrencyInput_ to the _EditListingPricingForm_. The id and
name of this field will be _cleaningFee_. Adding this fee will be
optional so we don't want to add any _validate_ param to the
_FieldCurrencyInput_ like there is in the _price_ input.

```shell
└── src
    └── forms
        └── EditListingPricingForm
            └── EditListingPricingForm.js
```

```jsx
...

<FieldCurrencyInput
    id="price"
    name="price"
    className={css.priceInput}
    autoFocus
    label={pricePerUnitMessage}
    placeholder={pricePlaceholderMessage}
    currencyConfig={config.currencyConfig}
    validate={priceValidators}
  />

<FieldCurrencyInput
  id="cleaningFee"
  name="cleaningFee"
  className={css.cleaningFeeInput}
  autoFocus
  label={cleaningFeeMessage}
  placeholder={cleaningFeePlaceholderMessage}
  currencyConfig={config.currencyConfig}
/>
...
```

After adding the new translations keys and some padding to price input
in CSS file, the EditListingPricingPanel should look something like
this:

![EditListingPricePanel](./editlistingpricepanel.png)

## Update BookingDatesForm

In our example the cleaning fee is optional and users can select that as
an add-on to their booking. In this section, we will add the UI
component for selecting the cleaning fee and pass the information about
the user's choice to the the backend of our client app.

> **Note**: In case you would like to add the cleaning fee automatically
> to every booking, you don't need to add the UI component for selecting
> the cleaning fee and you can move forward to the next section: Add a
> transaction line item for the cleaning fee.

### Prepare props

In order to be able to use the information about cleaning fee inside the
_BookingDatesForm_ we need to pass some new information from
_BookingPanel_ to the form. BookingPanel is component that is used on
_ListingPage_ and _TransactionPage_ to show the booking breakdown.

```shell
└── src
    └── components
        └── BookingPanel
            └── BookingPanel.js
```

_BookingPanel_ gets **listing** as a prop. The cleaning fee is now saved
to listing's public data so we can find it under the _publicData_ key
from listing's attributes. Because we decided that adding a cleaning fee
to listing's information is optional, we need to check if the
cleaningFee exists in public data or not.

```jsx
const cleaningFee =
  listing.attributes.publicData &&
  listing.attributes.publicData.cleaningFee
    ? listing.attributes.publicData.cleaningFee
    : null;
```

Once we have saved the information about the cleaning fee to variable
_cleaningFee_ we need to pass that forward to _BookingDatesForm_. This
form is used for collecting the booking data (e.g. booking dates) and
values from this form will be used when creating the transaction
lineItems. We will pass the _cleaningFee_ to this form as a new prop.

```diff
  <BookingDatesForm
    className={css.bookingForm}
    formId="BookingPanel"
    submitButtonWrapperClassName={css.bookingDatesSubmitButtonWrapper}
    unitType={unitType}
    onSubmit={onSubmit}
    price={price}
    listingId={listing.id}
    isOwnListing={isOwnListing}
    timeSlots={timeSlots}
    fetchTimeSlotsError={fetchTimeSlotsError}
    onFetchTransactionLineItems={onFetchTransactionLineItems}
    lineItems={lineItems}
    fetchLineItemsInProgress={fetchLineItemsInProgress}
    fetchLineItemsError={fetchLineItemsError}
+  cleaningFee={cleaningFee}
  />
```

### Add cleaning fee checkbox

Next, we need to add a new field to _BookingDatesForm_ for selecting the
possible cleaning fee. For this, we will use the **FieldCheckbox**
component because want the cleaning fee to be optional.

```shell
└── src
    └── forms
        └── BookingDatesForm
            └── BookingDatesForm.js
```

In _BookingDatesForm_ we need to import a couple of new resources we
will need for adding the cleaning fee. These will be some helper
functions needed to handle the cleaningFee price information and the
checkbox component _FieldCheckbox_.

```diff
  import { propTypes } from '../../util/types';
+ import { formatMoney } from '../../util/currency';
+ import { types as sdkTypes } from '../../util/sdkLoader';
  import config from '../../config';
  import {
    Form,
    IconSpinner,
    PrimaryButton,
    FieldDateRangeInput,
+   FieldCheckbox,
} from '../../components';
 import EstimatedBreakdownMaybe from './EstimatedBreakdownMaybe';

 import css from './BookingDatesForm.module.css';
+ const { Money } = sdkTypes;
```

When we have imported these files, we will add the component for showing
the checkbox for selecting the cleaning fee. For this, we need to
extract the cleaningFee from **fieldRenderProps**.

```diff
    ...
    lineItems,
    fetchLineItemsInProgress,
    fetchLineItemsError,
+   cleaningFee,
  } = fieldRenderProps;
```

We want to show the amount of cleaning fee to the user in the checkbox
label so we need to format the cleaningFee to printable form. For this
we want to use _formatMoney_ function which will use localized
formatting. This function expects Money object as parameter so we need
to do the conversion.

```jsx
const formattedCleaningFee = cleaningFee
  ? formatMoney(
      intl,
      new Money(cleaningFee.amount, cleaningFee.currency)
    )
  : null;

const cleaningFeeLabel = intl.formatMessage(
  { id: 'BookingDatesForm.cleaningFeeLabel' },
  { fee: formattedCleaningFee }
);
```

We will also add new translation key _BookingDatesForm.cleaningFeeLabel_
to **_en.json_** file where we can use **_fee_** variable to show the
price.

```js
  "BookingDatesForm.cleaningFeeLabel": "Cleaning fee: {fee}",
```

Because there might be listing's without cleaning fee, we want to show
the checkbox only when needed. This is why we will create the
**cleaningFeeMaybe** component which is rendered only if the listing has
the cleaning fee saved to the public data.

```jsx
const cleaningFeeMaybe = cleaningFee ? (
  <FieldCheckbox
    id="cleaningFee"
    name="cleaningFee"
    label={cleaningFeeLabel}
    value="cleaningFee"
  />
) : null;
```

Then we can add the **cleaningFeeMaybe** to the returned `<Form>`
component

```diff
...
    timeSlots={timeSlots}
    useMobileMargins
    validate={composeValidators(
      required(requiredMessage),
      bookingDatesRequired(startDateErrorMessage, endDateErrorMessage)
    )}
    disabled={fetchLineItemsInProgress}
  />

+ {cleaningFeeMaybe}

  {bookingInfoMaybe}
  {loadingSpinnerMaybe}
  {bookingInfoErrorMaybe}
...
```

After this step, the BookingDatesForm should look like this. You should
notice that the cleaning fee will not be visible in the booking
breakdown yet even though we added the new checkbox.

![Cleaning fee checkbox](./cleaningFeeCheckbox.png)

### Update the bookingData

Next, we want to pass the value of the cleaning fee checkbox forward as
part of the **bookingData**. This is needed so that we can show the
selected cleaning fee as a new row on the booking breakdown. To achieve
this, we need to edit the _handleOnChange_ function which takes the
values from the form and calls the _onFetchTransactionLineItems_
function for constructing the transaction line items. These line items
are shown inside the _bookingInfoMaybe_ component under the form fields.

<extraInfo title="What are line items?">

In Flex, the total price of a transaction is defined by its line items.
Line items describe what is included in a transaction. It can be a
varying set of things from the number of booked units to customer and
provider commissions, add-ons, discounts, or payment refunds.

Every line item has a unit price and one of the following attributes:
quantity or percentage. The quantity attribute can be used to denote the
number of booked units, like the number of booked nights. Quantity can
also be defined as a multiplication of units and seats. The percentage
param is used when modeling commissions for example. Based on these
attributes a line total is calculated for each line item. Line totals
then define the total payin and payout sums of the transaction.

You can read more about line items and pricing from
[pricing background article](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/background/pricing/).

</extraInfo>

In the **bookingData** object, we will have all the information about
the user's choices. In this case, it means booking dates and if they
selected the cleaning fee or not. We only need the information if the
cleaning fee was selected. We will fetch the cleaning fee details from
Marketplace API later in the the backend of our client app to make sure
this information can't be manipulated.

In our case, because there is just one checkbox, it's enough to check
the length of that array to determine if any items are selected. If the
length of the cleaningFee array inside values is bigger than 0, the
_hasCleaningFee_ param is true and otherwise false. If we hade more than
one item in the checkbox group then we should check which items were
selected.

```jsx
  handleOnChange(formValues) {
    const { startDate, endDate } =
      formValues.values && formValues.values.bookingDates ? formValues.values.bookingDates : {};
    const hasCleaningFee =
      formValues.values.cleaningFee && formValues.values.cleaningFee.length > 0;

    const listingId = this.props.listingId;
    const isOwnListing = this.props.isOwnListing;

    if (startDate && endDate && !this.props.fetchLineItemsInProgress) {
      this.props.onFetchTransactionLineItems({
        bookingData: { startDate, endDate, hasCleaningFee },
        listingId,
        isOwnListing,
      });
    }
  }
```

## Add a new line-item for the cleaning fee

Finally, we need to edit the the backend of our client app and add new
line item for cleaning fee so that it will be included in pricing. Flex
uses privileged transitions to ensure that the pricing logic is handled
in a secure environment. This means that constructing line items and
transitioning requests of privileged transitions are made from the
server-side.

<extraInfo title="What are privileged transitions and why we use them?">

Privileged transitions are transaction process transitions that can be
invoked only from a secure context. For example, when using Flex
Templates for Web this secure context is the backend of our client app.
You can also build your own server-side validation that sits between
your marketplace UI and the Flex Marketplace API to invoke privileged
transitions.

We are using privileged transitions and the backend of our client app
for constructing line items because we want to make sure this is done in
a secure context. If the client-side code (FTW-frontend) could freely
construct the line items, we couldn't fully trust that the price
calculation follows the model intended in the marketplace. In theory, a
marketplace user could make a direct API call to the Flex Marketplace
API and start a transaction with modified line items (e.g. change the
amount of cleaning fee). When we use the privileged transitions and
fetch the pricing information like the cleaning fee amount directly from
Marketplace API in the backend of our client app, we can avoid this
security risk.

You can read more about privileged transitions from
[privileged transitions background article](/background/privileged-transitions/).

</extraInfo>

When we want to add a new line item for cleaning fee, we'll need to
update the pricing logic in the _lineItems.js_ file:

```shell
└── server
    └── api-util
        ├── lineItems.js
        └── lineItemHelpers.js
```

### Resolve the cleaning fee

First, we will add a new helper function for resolving the cleaning fee
line item. This function will take the listing as a parameter and then
get the cleaning fee from its public data. We don't want to pass this
data from FTW-frontend directly so it' can be not manipulated. Instead,
we check it from the listing that was fetched from Marketplace API.

If you have many helper functions you might want to add this function to
the `lineItemHelpers.js` file instead.

```jsx
const resolveCleaningFeePrice = listing => {
  const publicData = listing.attributes.publicData;
  const cleaningFee = publicData && publicData.cleaningFee;
  const { amount, currency } = cleaningFee;

  if (amount && currency) {
    return new Money(amount, currency);
  }

  return null;
};
```

### Add line-item

Now the transactionLineItems function can be updated to also provide the
cleaning fee line item in case the listing has a cleaning fee
configured.

In this example, we decided that the provider commission is calculated
from the total of booking and cleaning fees. That's why we need to add
the _cleaningFee_ item also to _calculateTotalFromLineItems(...)_
function on providerCommission line item. If we don't add the cleaning
fee there the provider commission is calculated only based on the
booking fee.

Remember also to add cleaning fee to _lineItems_ array which is returned
in the end of the function.

```diff
exports.transactionLineItems = (listing, bookingData) => {
  const unitPrice = listing.attributes.price;
  const { startDate, endDate, hasCleaningFee } = bookingData;

  const booking = {
    code: 'line-item/night',
    unitPrice,
    quantity: calculateQuantityFromDates(startDate, endDate, unitType),
    includeFor: ['customer', 'provider'],
  };

+ const cleaningFeePrice = hasCleaningFee ? resolveCleaningFeePrice(listing) : null;
+ const cleaningFee = cleaningFeePrice
+   ? [
+       {
+         code: 'line-item/cleaning-fee',
+         unitPrice: cleaningFeePrice,
+         quantity: 1,
+         includeFor: ['customer', 'provider'],
+       },
+     ]
+   : [];
+

  const providerCommission = {
    code: 'line-item/provider-commission',
+   unitPrice: calculateTotalFromLineItems([booking, ...cleaningFee]),
    percentage: PROVIDER_COMMISSION_PERCENTAGE,
    includeFor: ['provider'],
  };

+ const lineItems = [booking, ...cleaningFee, providerCommission];

  return lineItems;
};
```

Once we have done the changes to the backend of our client app we can
check the booking breakdown again. Now if you choose the cleaning fee,
you should see the cleaning fee also in the booking breakdown:
