## Removing Stripe

In this guide, we will go through the minimum changes needed to make the
booking flow work without Stripe. This is not an easy customization
project. The Sharetribe Web Template works with specific transaction
processes and payments are a core feature of each: its ubiquitous nature
means that you need to touch quite many components and files. Most
likely you need to customize some parts (e.g. transaction process, email
templates, checkout page) more depending on your marketplace idea. For
example, you might also want to remove unused Stripe components from
your project to clean up the code.

### 1. Update the transaction processes and remove Stripe related actions

You need to remove at least the following actions:

- :action/stripe-create-payment-intent
- :action/stripe-capture-payment-intent
- :action/stripe-confirm-payment-intent
- :action/stripe-create-payout
- :action/stripe-refund-charge
- :action/stripe-refund-payment

If you are using the template default processes with strong customer
authentication (e.g. `default-booking` or `default-purchase`) you need
to remove confirming the payment. Otherwise, the transaction will get
stuck. The simplest way to do this is to remove `pending-payment` and
`expire-payment` states and point `request-payment` and
`request-payment-after-inquiry` directly to the following state â€“
`preauthorized` in `default-booking` and `purchased` in
`default-purchase`.

However, when you are building the transaction process to your
marketplace it might make sense to rename some of the states and
transitions so that they make more sense in your use-case. For instance,
_preauthorized_ state refers to the state of payment - it is
preauthorized to be captured.

#### Edit the transaction process file to reflect the changes in your transaction process

The [src/transactions/transaction.js](todo: repo link) has a number of
helper functions that are used to determine which state the transaction
is. Depending on the transaction process being used, the
_transaction.js_ file refers to either
_src/transactions/transactionProcessBooking.js_ or
_src/transactions/transactionProcessPurchase.js_ for the correct states
in each process. The transaction process file should be updated to match
the new transaction process.
[Read more about editing transaction related files](/how-to/change-transaction-process-in-ftw/#2-update-the-relevant-files-in-srctransactions-folder).

Example:

```diff
     [STATE_INITIAL]: {
       on: {
         [TRANSITION_INQUIRE]: STATE_INQUIRY,
-        [TRANSITION_REQUEST_PAYMENT]: STATE_PENDING_PAYMENT,
+        [TRANSITION_REQUEST_PAYMENT]: STATE_PREAUTHORIZED,
       },
     },
     [STATE_INQUIRY]: {
       on: {
-        [TRANSITION_REQUEST_PAYMENT_AFTER_INQUIRY]: STATE_PENDING_PAYMENT,
+        [TRANSITION_REQUEST_PAYMENT_AFTER_INQUIRY]: STATE_PREAUTHORIZED,
       },
     },
-
-    [STATE_PENDING_PAYMENT]: {
-      on: {
-        [TRANSITION_EXPIRE_PAYMENT]: STATE_PAYMENT_EXPIRED,
-        [TRANSITION_CONFIRM_PAYMENT]: STATE_PREAUTHORIZED,
-      },
-    },
-
-    [STATE_PAYMENT_EXPIRED]: {},
     [STATE_PREAUTHORIZED]: {
       on: {
         [TRANSITION_DECLINE]: STATE_DECLINED,

```

### 2. Remove Stripe checks from EditListingWizard

In [`EditListingWizard.js`](todo: update link) we are checking if the
provider has a Stripe account with all the required information before
we allow them to publish listings. This check is done in the
`handlePublishListing` function and needs to be removed.

```js
  handlePublishListing(id) {
    this.props.onPublishListingDraft(id);
  }
```

After changing the `handlePublishListing` you can remove unused code.
You also might want to clean up `EditListingPage` and remove the Stripe
related props we pass to `EditListingWizard`.

### 3. Edit ModalMissingInformation

By default, [`ModalMissingInformation`](todo: link) will remind users to
create a Stripe account. The same modal is used for reminding about
email verification so we should just remove the Stripe related code from
the component.

### 4. Edit CheckoutPage

Removing Stripe from `CheckoutPage` is probably the most complicated
task in this list because the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) and
ability to save payment method have added a lot of logic to the current
page. We can use an edited version of CheckoutPage from a legacy
template (FTW 2.17.1) as a simpler starting point:

- [SimpleCheckoutPage.js](/tutorial-assets/SimpleCheckoutPage.js)

Some of the functions on later versions of CheckoutPage.duck.js have
changed, so here are the main changes done in the edited code:

- In `handleSubmit` function we only call onInitiateOrder function,
  which internally decides if the transaction should be initiated or
  transitioned. We also need to handle sending the possible initial
  message after that.

```js
  handleSubmit(values) {
    if (this.state.submitting) {
      return;
    }

    this.setState({ submitting: true });

    const initialMessage = values.initialMessage;
    const { history, speculatedTransaction, dispatch, onInitiateOrder, onSendMessage } = this.props;

    // Create order aka transaction
    // NOTE: if unit type is line-item/units, quantity needs to be added.
    // The way to pass it to checkout page is through pageData.bookingData
    const requestParams = {
      listingId: this.state.pageData.listing.id,
      bookingStart: speculatedTransaction.booking.attributes.start,
      bookingEnd: speculatedTransaction.booking.attributes.end,
    };

    const inquiredTransaction = this.state.pageData.inquiredTransaction;
    const transactionIdMaybe = inquiredTransaction ? inquiredTransaction.id : null;

    onInitiateOrder(requestParams, transactionIdMaybe).then(params => {
      onSendMessage({ ...params, message: initialMessage })
        .then(values => {
          const { orderId, messageSuccess } = values;
          this.setState({ submitting: false });
          const routes = routeConfiguration();
          const OrderPage = findRouteByRouteName('OrderDetailsPage', routes);

          // Transaction is already created, but if the initial message
          // sending failed, we tell it to the OrderDetailsPage.
          dispatch(
            OrderPage.setInitialValues({
              initialMessageFailedToTransaction: messageSuccess ? null : orderId,
            })
          );
          const orderDetailsPath = pathByRouteName('OrderDetailsPage', routes, {
            id: orderId.uuid,
          });
          clearData(STORAGE_KEY);
          history.push(orderDetailsPath);
        })
        .catch(() => {
          this.setState({ submitting: false });
        });
    });
  }
```

- Replace `StripePaymentForm` with something else. In this example we
  have simple `bookingForm` which has input for initial message and
  button for booking.

```js
const bookingForm = (
  <FinalForm
    onSubmit={values => this.handleSubmit(values)}
    render={fieldRenderProps => {
      const { handleSubmit } = fieldRenderProps;
      return (
        <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
          {showInitialMessageInput ? (
            <div>
              <h3 className={css.messageHeading}>
                <FormattedMessage id="StripePaymentForm.messageHeading" />
              </h3>

              <FieldTextInput
                type="textarea"
                id={`bookingForm-message`}
                name="initialMessage"
                label={initialMessageLabel}
                placeholder={messagePlaceholder}
                className={css.message}
              />
            </div>
          ) : null}
          <div className={css.submitContainer}>
            <PrimaryButton
              className={css.submitButton}
              type="submit"
              inProgress={this.state.submitting}
              disabled={false}
            >
              Confirm booking
            </PrimaryButton>
          </div>
        </Form>
      );
    }}
  />
);
```

### 5. Hide/remove Stripe related pages

If you are not using Stripe you should remove or at least hide the pages
that are meant for managing the information saved to Stripe. These pages
are [StripePayoutPage](todo: link) and [PaymentMethodsPage](todo: link).
Both of these pages are accessible through the account settings so we
want to remove them from both navigation component and route
configuration.

Changes to `LayoutWrapperAccountSettingsSideNav`

```diff
        name: 'PasswordChangePage',
      },
    },
-    {
-      text: <FormattedMessage id="LayoutWrapperAccountSettingsSideNav.paymentsTabTitle" />,
-      selected: currentTab === 'StripePayoutPage',
-      id: 'StripePayoutPageTab',
-      linkProps: {
-        name: 'StripePayoutPage',
-      },
-    },
-    {
-      text: <FormattedMessage id="LayoutWrapperAccountSettingsSideNav.paymentMethodsTabTitle" />,
-      selected: currentTab === 'PaymentMethodsPage',
-      id: 'PaymentMethodsPageTab',
-      linkProps: {
-        name: 'PaymentMethodsPage',
-      },
-    },
  ];

  return <LayoutWrapperSideNav tabs={tabs} />;
```

Changes to `routeConfiguration.js`

```diff
-export const ACCOUNT_SETTINGS_PAGES = [
-  'ContactDetailsPage',
-  'PasswordChangePage',
-  'StripePayoutPage',
-  'PaymentMethodsPage',
-];
+export const ACCOUNT_SETTINGS_PAGES = ['ContactDetailsPage', 'PasswordChangePage'];
```

### Extra: Removing unused exports

This is not a mandatory step to do but if you want to clean up the code
you can go through the `components/index.js` and `containers/index.js`,
and remove the Stripe components. After this, you should go through the
whole codebase and remove all the references to these components. We
have tried to follow the naming pattern where Stripe related components
have `Stripe` in their name but there are a couple of exceptions like
`PaymentMethodsPage`. All these components should be removed also from
`examples.js`.

Stripe related components:

- StripeBankAccountTokenInputField
- StripeConnectAccountStatusBox
- StripePaymentAddress
- StripePayoutPage
- PaymentMethodsPage
- PaymentMethodsForm
- StripePaymentForm
- StripeConnectAccountForm

// TODO Update repo link You can also remove Stripe script form
[public/index.html](https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily/blob/master/public/index.html#L169).

## Removing payments

If you want to remove payments completely from your marketplace, there
are even more things to consider. Again it depends a lot on your
use-case what kind of changes are needed. If you e.g. want to add a
transaction process with free transactions, you need to build the
conditional logic for showing pricing components when needed and hiding
them when not. If you want to build the marketplace completely without
payments, you most likely want to hide all the references to listing
price.

### More changes to the transaction process

Remove the actions related to payments, e.g.
`:action/privileged-set-line-items` and `:action/calculate-full-refund`
in the default processes. Read more about actions in the
[transaction process actions refrence article.](/references/transaction-process-actions/)
Remember to also update email templates that contain pricing
information.

### Edit API calls in client app's server

You will need to edit the API calls in your client app's server. If
there are no payments used, there is most likely no need for calculating
line items, so we can remove `transactionLineItems` function calls from
API endpoints. Depending on your use case, you may or may not want to
use the privileged transitions at all. However, in case you are updating
e.g. transaction protected data, it is a good practice to do that safely
in the template's backend.

### Other code changes

Especially if you are removing the payment completely from your
marketplace, you should also go through all these pages to hide or
remove the parts related to payments.

- ListingPage, CheckoutPage, TransactionPage: Remove or hide
  `BookingBreakdown` component when the transaction is free
- EditListingPage: remove pricing tab from `EditListingWizard`
- SearchPage: remove price filter & edit `ListingCard` so that it
  doesn't show the listing price
