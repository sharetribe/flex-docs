## What is a production environment and how does it differ from a test environment?

## Where to host your production environment?

- Heroku, render, aws
- What to consider when hosting
- Why can't ftw be hosted on serverless platforms such as Vercel or
  Netlify

## Launching to production

- Some environment vars need to be changed, such as Set NODE_ENV to
  'production'
