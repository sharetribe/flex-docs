## API Reference

**[Access the Sharetribe Flex API reference here](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference)**

The Sharetribe Flex API consists of three individual APIs:

- [Marketplace API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html)
- [Integration API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/integration.html)
- [Authentication API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/authentication.html)

All three are HTTP APIs. The Marketplace API and the Integration API support both JSON and Transit formats. The Authentication API is used to obtain access tokens for use with the other APIs and is based on OAuth2. The easiest way the access all three APIs is to use our [JavaScript SDKs](https://sharetribe.github.io/flex-sdk-js/).

If you are interested in reading more about the Marketplace and Integration API, refer to our background article on [Marketplace and Integration API](/background/marketplace-api-integration-api/).
For more information on our Authentication API, refer to our background article on the [Authentication API](/background/authentication-api/).
