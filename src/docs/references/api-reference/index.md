## Introduction

**[Access the Sharetribe Flex API reference here](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference)**

The Sharetribe Flex API consists of three individual APIs:

- [Marketplace API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html)
- [Integration API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/integration.html)
- [Authentication API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/authentication.html)

All three are HTTP APIs and both the Integration API and Marketplace API support JSON and Transit formats. The Authentication API is based on OAuth2. Our API documentation provides further technical detail on all three APIs. If you are looking for a way to use the APIs in your client or server application, refer to our documentation on our [JavaScript SDKs.](https://sharetribe.github.io/flex-sdk-js/)

If you are interested in reading more about the Marketplace and Integration API, refer to our background article on [Marketplace and Integration API](/background/marketplace-api-integration-api/).
