A transaction process contains transitions and each transition defines
an ordered list of 0 or more actions. Actions are instructions for the
transaction engine and define what happens when a transition is
executed. The ordering of the actions matters because they are executed
in the given order.

This is a reference for all the available actions with their
preconditions, parameters, and configuration options. With
**parameters** we mean values that are sent in the API calls to the
actions, and with **configuration options** we mean the options that are
set for the actions in the `process.edn` file. To learn more, see the
[Transaction process format](/references/transaction-process-format/)
reference article.

## Actions

### Transaction initialization

#### :action.initializer/init-listing-tx

**NOTE**: this action is implicit and must not be in the process
description.

Initialize a new transaction from a listing.

**Preconditions**:

- Listing with the given ID must exist
- Listing must have an author
- Customer (actor of the transaction) must be a valid user
- Author and customer must not be the same user

**Parameters**:

- `listingId`, UUID, mandatory

**Configuration options**: -

### Pricing

#### :action/privileged-set-line-items

Defines transaction price and breakdown. Sets given line items and
calculates totals for each line item and for the entire transaction.

Existing line items will be removed.

**Preconditions**: -

**Parameters**:

- `lineItems`: Collection of line items (max 50). Each line items has
  following fields:
  - `code`: string, mandatory, indentifies line item type (e.g.
    "line-item/cleaning-fee"), maximum length 64 characters.
  - `unitPrice`: money, mandatory
  - `lineTotal`: money
  - `quantity`: number
  - `percentage`: number (e.g. 15.5 for 15.5%)
  - `seats`: number
  - `units`: number
  - `includeFor`: array containing strings "customer" or "provider",
    default ["customer" ":provider" ]

Line item must have either `quantity` or `percentage` or both `seats`
and `units`.

`lineTotal` is calculated by the following rules:

- If `quantity` is provided, the line total will be
  `unitPrice * quantity`.
- If `percentage` is provided, the line total will be
  `unitPrice * (percentage / 100)`.
- If `seats` and `units` are provided the line item will contain
  `quantity` as a product of `seats` and `units` and the line total will
  be `unitPrice * units * seats`.

`lineTotal` can be optionally passed in. Will be validated against
calculated line total.

`includeFor` defines commissions. Customer commission is added by
defining `includeFor` array `["customer"]` and provider commission by
`["provider"]`.

`payinTotal` is calculated by the action and added to the transaction.
`payinTotal` equals to the sum of customer commission line totals and
other non-commission line totals. Must be positive and larger than
`payoutTotal`

`payoutTotal` is calculated by the action and added to the transaction.
`payoutTotal` equals to the sum of provider commission line totals and
other non-commission line totals. Must be zero or positive.

Only one currency is allowed accross all fields defining money.

**Configuration options**: -

#### :action/calculate-tx-customer-commission

**Deprecated**: use `:privileged-set-line-items` to have full control of
the calculation and the line items

Calculates the customer commission, sets the transaction payin amount
and adds a `:line-item/customer-commission` line-item.

Subsequent executions will create new line items instead of modifying
the existing one. Commission calculations are based on
transaction/totalPrice and will accumulate the payinTotal. For example,
a total price of 100 EUR and two consequtive 10 % customer commissions
will result in an 120 EUR payin.

**Preconditions**:

- Transaction must have a total price
- All currencies must match the listing currency
- Min and max commissions need to be in correct order, i.e, min needs to
  be smaller than max

**Parameters**: -

**Configuration options**:

- `commission`: decimal, mandatory. Acts as a multiplier on the
  transaction total, e.g. `0.1M` for a 10% commission.
- `min`: a map with keys `:amount` and `:currency`, optional. Acts as a
  minimum commission, e.g. {:amount 2M, :currency "EUR"} for a 2EUR
  minimum.
- `max`: a map with keys `:amount` and `:currency`, optional. Acts as a
  maximum commission, e.g. {:amount 20M, :currency "EUR"} for a 20EUR
  maximum.

Where:

- `amount`, decimal, mandatory. The value of a monetary unit. A decimal
  followed with a `M`, e.g. 10M.

and adds a `:line-item/provider-commission` line-item.

Subsequent executions will create new line items instead of modifying
the existing one. Commission calculations are based on
transaction/totalPrice and will accumulate the payoutTotal. For example,
a total price of 100 EUR and two consequtive 10 % provider commissions
will result in an 80 EUR payout.

Too large commission (i.e. a negative payout) will cause an error.

**Configuration options**:

- `key-mapping`: map (keyword -> keyword), optional

  Defines which keys are revealed to the transaction. Also can be used
  to rename keys so that the transaction's protected data will use

**Preconditions**: -

**Parameters**: -

**Configuration options**:

- `key-mapping`: map (keyword -> keyword), optional

  Defines which keys are revealed to the transaction. Also can be used
  to rename keys so that the transaction's protected data will use
  different keys than the user's protected data does. For example,the
  following config will reveal provider's phoneNumber attribute to the

**Parameters**:

- `protectedData`: JSON object, max 50KB, optional

**Configuration options**: -

### Stripe integration

#### :action/stripe-create-payment-intent

Action for creating a Stripe Payment Intent for the transaction.

Payment Intents are the main supported way to collect payments.
Transaction processes need to use them especially if they want to be
SCA-compatible.

**Preconditions**:

- The transaction must already have pricing information (i.e. pay-in and
  pay-out totals) calculated.
- If `:use-customer-default-payment-method?` is set `true`, customer
  must have Stripe Customer and default payment method set.

**Parameters:**

- `paymentMethod`, string, optional. Stripe PaymentMethod ID of payment
  method to be used in the payment. If not given, client is responsible
  for attaching a PaymentMethod to the PaymentIntent via e.g. Stripe.js
  SDK.
- `setupPaymentMethodForSaving`, boolean, optional. If set to true, the
  PaymentIntent is created in such a way so that the PaymentMethod used
  in the payment can be later attached to a Stripe Customer. Otherwise,
  the PaymentMethod (if new) can not be used in any other way again
  after the payment. After payment is done via the transaction process,
  the client can use Marketplace API operations
  `/stripe_customer/add_payment_method` or `/stripe_customer/create` to
  attach the payment method to a Customer or create a new Customer if
  one didn't exist.

**Configurations:**

- `:use-customer-default-payment-method?`, boolean, optional. If set to
  `true`, the payment intent is created using the Customer's default
  payment method and it is created as an off-session payment in Stripe
  (i.e. customer not present). Intended to be used in transitions where
  customer is not present (i.e. delayed transitions, or ones triggered
  by operator or provider). This tells Stripe to attempt to exempt the
  payment from SCA. However, the bank in question may still require
  authentication. If the bank requires authentication from the customer,
  or declines the charge for any reason, the Stripe API call will fail
  and the transition using this action will fail. The action also
  automatically confirms the payment intent, i.e.
  `:action/stripe-confirm-payment-intent` must not be included in this
  or subsequent transitions.

#### :action/stripe-capture-payment-intent

Action for capturing a confirmed Stripe PaymentIntent.

**Preconditions:**

- Transaction must have a payment that has been confirmed with
  `:action/stripe-confirm-payment-intent`
- Provider must have connected Stripe account

**Parameters:** - **Configurations:** -

#### :action/stripe-confirm-payment-intent

Action for confirming payment intent that is in pending state.

**Preconditions**:

- Transaction must have a payment created with
  `:action/stripe-create-payment-intent`.

**Parameters:** - **Configurations:** -

#### :action/stripe-create-payout

Create pay out to external bank account. The managed account must have
sufficient available balance.

**Preconditions**:

- Transaction must have pay-out value set
- Transaction must have a Stripe transfer

**Parameters**: -

**Configuration options**: -

#### :action/stripe-refund-charge

**DEPRECATED**: same as `:action/stripe-refund-payment`, use that
instead

#### :action/stripe-refund-payment

Refund (in full) a Stripe payment. Supports both cancelling a
PaymentIntent that has not yet been captured, as well as issuing a
Stripe refund for a charge if the charge was captured or if the charge
was created directly without using a PaymentIntent.

**Preconditions**:

- Transaction must have a pay in
- Transaction must have the required Stripe payment data
- Pay in must be in one of the following states: payment.in/pending,
  payment.in/preauthorized, payment.in/paid
