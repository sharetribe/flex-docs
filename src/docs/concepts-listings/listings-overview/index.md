  Flex powers online marketplaces, and listings are at the core of any
  marketplace. This article explains the different aspects of listings

On a Flex marketplace, listings represent the items, facilities or
services that users buy and sell or book and offer. Using extended data,
listings can be modified to cover several different kinds of
marketplaces.

## Listing lifecycle

Between being created and deleted, listings go through several different
states. Depending on the listing's state, they are either returned with
the public Listing endpoints or they are only available to the listing's
author.

When tracking [listing events](TODO) through the
[Integration API](TODO), it is important to also pay attention to the
state of the listing. For instance, in the default FTW template
implementation the listing is created as draft and then goes through
several updates in the draft state before it is published. In other
words, to catch the correct listing event, it is useful to filter by
both event type and listing state.

### Draft

When a listing is first created, it is created in **state: draft**.
Draft listings are not returned by the [listings/query](TODO) endpoint,
but they are visible to the author and through Flex Console. Draft
listings can be published using the [own_listings/publish_draft](TODO)
endpoint.

### Pending approval

If the marketplace
[requires listing approval for new listings](/concepts/requiring-approval/),
a draft listing does not get published directly when the
[own_listings/publish_draft](TODO) is called. Instead, it moves into
**state: pendingApproval**. The operator can then approve the listing in
Flex Console or, if the approval is dependent on e.g. an extended data
attribute, through the
[listing approval Integration API endpoint](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/integration.html#approve-listing).
A use case for this would be e.g. a marketplace where non-paid members
can publish one listing and paid members can publish unlimited listings
â€“ an integration could check whether the user has a `premium: true` flag
in their metadata and approve the listing accordingly.

### Published

Published listings are returned by [listings/query](TODO) and
[listings/show](TODO) endpoints.

After a listing has been published, it can still be modified by the
author. Even if the marketplace has listing approval enabled, modifying
listings after they are published does not set them back to the
**pendingApproval** state. This means that the listing approval feature
can not fully be used to moderate e.g. listing content, but rather the
number of listings each user has active on the marketplace.

### Closed

A listing can be closed by both the author and the marketplace operator.
A closed listing is not returned by the [listings/query](TODO) and
[listings/show](TODO) endpoints, but it is still returned by the
[own_listings/query](TODO) and [own_listings/show](TODO) endpoints, i.e.
it is visible to the author. Both author and marketplace operator can
also [open the listing](TODO) after it has been closed i.e. set its
state back to published.

### Deleted

Listings in Flex can only be deleted by the operator in Flex Console. In
addition, if the author's user account is deleted, all their listings
are marked deleted as well. Listing deletion is permanent. Deleted
listings don't get returned by any listing endpoints. If a marketplace
user has transactions related to a deleted listing, however, the deleted
listing can be returned as an included related resource with no other
data than the listing id and `deleted: true`.

## Listing extended data

Listings are one of the resource types in Flex where you can add
[extended data](/references/extended-data/). This means that listings
can have custom attributes beyond the default ones that Flex offers.
Extended data can be managed through Marketplace API
[own_listings](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html#own-listings)
and Integration API
[listings](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/integration.html#listings)
create and update endpoints, as well as in Flex Console for individual
listings.

Two example use cases for listing extended data are custom search and
differentiating between listing types. However, listing extended data is
a powerful feature to customise listing behavior in Flex, so there are
multiple use cases that can be solved with setting attributes in listing
extended data and then either passing those attributes as query
parameters or managing the client application behavior based on the
attributes.

### Custom listing search

One of the most powerful features of Flex is the listing search using
the
[listings/query](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html#query-listings)
endpoint. By default, you can query by price,
[keywords, origin,](/concepts/how-the-listing-search-works/) bounds,
availability, and stock, among others.

In addition to the default parameters, you can query listings by public
extended data attributes, i.e. public data and metadata. You will need
to [set a search schema](/how-to/manage-search-schemas-with-flex-cli/)
for the attribute so that it is indexed for search within Flex.

### Different types of listings

In addition to search filtering, you can also build views that filter
listings by type.

You can for instance create service listings with
[availability and bookings](/references/availability/), as well as
product listings with [stock](/references/stock/), in the same
marketplace, and differentiate them with a **listingType** attribute in
listing extended data.

By passing listing type as a query parameter to the endpoint, you can
then create differentiated views for the two types of listings. Again,
using extended data as query parameters requires
[setting a search schema](/how-to/manage-search-schemas-with-flex-cli/).

Some marketplaces want to allow filtering by entities that are not
strictly speaking listings available to be purchased. Examples include
searching by service provider, or searching for storefronts to see what
listings they offer. In these kinds of cases, it is useful to model
those elements as a new type of listing, and then determine their
behavior in the client app based on the extended data attribute.

For instance, the [FTW-hourly template](/ftw/ftw-hourly/) handles
[yoga teacher profiles as bookable listings](/introduction/introducing-yogatime/#profiles-as-bookable-listings),
which follows the concept of modeling entities as listings. You could
also create a searchable storefront listing that cannot itself be
booked, and instead it displays all the listings from that specific
provider and allows users to contact the store.

In Flex, listings can be modeled and modified to cover a range of
different use cases. If you are wondering about a use case for listings
in Flex, do reach out to Flex Support through the chat widget in your
Flex Console and let us know. We'll be happy to help you figure out your
specific use case and give you some suggestions for implementation.
