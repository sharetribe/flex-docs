\* The software itself is free, but there will be mandatory costs for
hosting and running your own platform. \$160 is an estimated base-level
running cost calculated by
[Dan Moore](http://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/2255).

\*\* Sharetribe Flex is specifically built to be adapted. First of all,
it comes with
[a complete website template](/introduction/introducing-template/) that
is easily customizable, so front-end changes are quick and
cost-effective to make.

Secondly, the back end is built for flexibility from the ground up. For
example, the [transaction processes](/concepts/transaction-process/)
have been designed so that it is very quick and easy to adjust them. You
can even create a completely new transaction process without coding
anything.

With Go Community Edition, every change needs to be coded from scratch.
Furthermore, you'll have to do a lot of refactoring to develop
efficiently. This results in much more developer work needed and a worse
developer experience.
