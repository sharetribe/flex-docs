Your starting marketplace app starts with generic content and configurations in many places. You'll want to modify these texts, pictures, and configurations to turn the generic marketplace into your own.

The following checklist provides an overview of every configuration in
the default marketplace that you should review. You will likely need to
change most or all of the defaults, but some of the defaults, like the
transaction process, can be kept if they work for you.

This checklist also provides an opportunity to learn
more about the no-code tools at your disposal.

any marketplace theme. Build your own messaging in the following steps.

your providers are offering on your marketplace.

## Go Live and customize further

Once you have completed these changes, it's time to review your
marketplace. If you are ready to launch to your first users, then you
need to set up a Live environment, host your marketplace code, and
configure your DNS. This process does require technical knowledge. You
can learn more about how to
[go Live here.](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/how-to-build-launch-operate-with-sharetribe-flex/#how-to-go-live)

Hosting your marketplace code lets anyone with development skills make
customizations beyond what is available with the no-code tools. You can
build custom features, create a custom design, integrate 3rd party
software, and much more with code. Unless you are a developer, you
should
[hire a developer](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/how-to-hire-developer/)
to make these coding changes.
