Building your marketplace with Flex typically starts by modifying your
example marketplace that has some generic assets. Learn more about what
to modify to turn the generic marketplace into one that reflects your
own.

The first step to building your marketplace is modifying the Flex
default configurations that do not apply to your marketplace. You can
modify these with no-code tools from
[Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/). Console is your
operator backend for configuring your marketplace without code and
viewing and managing your marketplace data, like users or listings.

The following checklist provides an overview of every configuration that
you should review. Certain defaults, like the marketplace name and logo,
will definitely need to be changed. Others, like the transaction
process, can be kept if they work for you.

In any case, the exhaustive checklist provides an opportunity to learn
more about the no-code tools at your disposal.

### Visual appearance

Modify the default brand and style to match your marketplace.

- Apply your branding by changing the default images and marketplace
  colours. Edit in [Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/) or

  [documentation](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/how-to-add-good-looking-logos-and-images/).
- Change the default background image and social media images. Edit in

### Content and microcopy

The default marketplace uses generic language that is not specific to
any marketplace theme. Build your own messaging in the following steps.

- Change the microcopy in your marketplace. Edit in
  [Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/) or learn more in the
  [documentation](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/how-to-use-microcopy-editor/).
- Change your marketplace landing page. Edit in
  [Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/) or learn more in the
  [documentation](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/how-to-edit-content-pages-in-console/).
- Update your Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Edit in
  [Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/) or learn more in the
  [documentation](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/free-templates/).
- Update the footer. Edit in
  [Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/) or learn more in the
  [documentation](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/how-footer-works/).
- Update your built-in emails. Edit in
  [Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/) or learn more in the
  [documentation](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/concepts/email-notifications/#built-in-email-notifications).

### Listings

On the default marketplace, providers can create generic listings.
Update the listing page, search page, and listing wizard to suit what
your providers are offering on your marketplace.

- Change your listing fields. Configure in
  [Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/) or learn more in the
  [documentation](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/listing-fields/).
- Change your listing layout. Configure in
  [Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/) or learn more in the
  [documentation](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/listing-page-image-layouts/).
- Change your search filters. Configure in
  [Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/) or learn more in the
  [documentation](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/how-search-works/).
- Change your search page layout. Configure in
  [Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/) or learn more in the
  [documentation](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/search-page-layout-options/).

### Transactions

On the default marketplace, customers can rent per day. If your
marketplace transaction is different, then make these changes.

- Update your listing types. Configure in
  [Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/) or learn more in the
  [documentation](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/what-are-listing-types/).
- Choose your transaction process. Configure in
  [Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/) or learn more in the
  [documentation](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/understanding-transaction-settings/).

## Go Live and customize further

Once you have completed these changes, it's time to review your
marketplace. If you are ready to launch to your first users, then you
need to set up a Live environment, host your marketplace code, and
configure your DNS. This process does require technical knowledge. You
can learn more about how to
[go Live here.](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/how-to-build-launch-operate-with-sharetribe-flex/#how-to-go-live)

Hosting your marketplace code lets anyone with development skills make
customizations beyond what is available with the no-code tools. You can
build custom features, create a custom design, integrate 3rd party
software, and much more with code. Unless you are a developer, you
should
[hire a developer](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/how-to-hire-developer/)
to make these coding changes.
