Why?
- user profiles cannot be searched in Flex, only listings
- Sometimes you'd want to search by provider while showing different types of listings
- use case:
  - user profile listings (not bookable) describing the provider, showcasing the provider's listings

- high-level explanation of creating a storefront with types of listings distinguished by extended data
  - provider creates a profile listing similarly to Yogatime
  - the profile listing contains some general information that can be copied to each item listing when they're created
