Your branding images help establish what your marketplace is all about.
Make sure your visual artifacts look great with these helpful tips.

## Ensure your images look good!

Your images should follow the recommended sizes to ensure that they look
good. Following the recommended sizes helps images fit their designated
presentation area properly. It also ensures that your images display
great across different sized screens from mobile to desktop.

You can learn what are the different branding images and their
recommended sizes in this
[article](/docs/operator-guides/introduction-to-marketplace-images).

If you don't follow the recommended sizes, your images might look
cropped, pixelated, or small.

If your image is cropped, then it is likely too big or not the right
proportions. You can resize or crop your marketplace photos using a
basic image editor (like Paint) or an online tool like
[Cropp.me](http://cropp.me/) or [Cut My Pic](http://www.cutmypic.com/).

If your image is pixelated or blurry, it may be too small or too low
quality. Try increasing the size of your logo.

If your image is too small, then there may be too much whitespace around
the it. Try to re-create your image with less border area. This can
happen with logos especially.

## Create a recognizable logo

The logo is perhaps the most important brand image asset in your
marketplace, and you should set one before you launch. However, creating
a logo can be challenging. Here is what you can do:

- Hire a designer on Upwork or Fiverr
- Use a paid service, like AI logo generator Brandmark
- Build your own with services like Canva's Logo Maker, logogenie, or
  logo.com.

## Tips for listing images

The listing images are the images that your providers or sellers use to
showcase the products, items or services theyâ€™re putting up for sale.
Most of the time you won't have control over the images that your users
upload. However, you can always guide your users to provide high quality
and correct images.

The listing image can be landscape, portrait or square, and the maximum
listing image size is 20 MB and 3072 x 3072 pixels. However, in order to
maximize performance, you might want to ask your users to upload smaller
images. Depending on the thumbnail ratio on your marketplace search
page, the recommended sizes vary quite a lot. You can learn more about
the listing thumbnail aspect ratio here, in
[this article from the layout section](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/listing-thumbnail-aspect-ratio/).
