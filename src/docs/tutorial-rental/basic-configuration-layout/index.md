## 1. Search page layout

### Choose: Map view.

Map view works better for marketplace that are location based. In Sauna rental marketplace user will probably want to search by location. 
## 2. Listing page image layout

### Choose: Screen-wide cover photo

This layout works particularly well for property rentals and other marketplaces that have large, beautiful images with landscape orientation.

## 3. Listing thumbnail aspect ratio

### Choose: Landscape (4:3)

Most Sauna images are probably taken in a landscape orientation and therefore the thumbnails will display more beautifully in the search results with this option.
