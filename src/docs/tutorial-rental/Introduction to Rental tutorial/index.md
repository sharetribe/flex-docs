Welcome to the rental tutorial! The goal of this guide is to assist you in becoming acquainted with the essential configuration pages for your Hosted app and discover all the required configurations for setting up a rental marketplace. 

We will focus exclusively on using the no-code settings of The New Sharetribe throughout this tutorial. Our step-by-step instructions will navigate you through the process of configuring your marketplace via the Console. Please note that all work will be carried out in your marketplace's Test environment.

## What are we building?

In this tutorial, we're going to kick things off with the default theme, Biketribe, and tweak it into a marketplace for renting saunas. We're going to call it "Saunatime." Now, while we're guiding you with specific steps to build Saunatime, feel free to mix things up a bit to create your marketplace. Just remember, if you switch things around, you'll need to keep track of those changes when following other steps in this tutorial. Along the way, we'll also cover a few key concepts to help you better understand the process.
