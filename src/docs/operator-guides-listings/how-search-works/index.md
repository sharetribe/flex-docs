Flex offers you several tools to help you build the right search experience for your users. 

Note that both anonymous users (users without a login) and logged in users can search and view listings created by providers on your marketplace. Only logged in users can initiate transactions on these listings.

## Keyword or location search 

By default, two types of search are available in your marketplace: keyword and location search. If you enable keyword search, your users search for listings by typing text into a search bar. When location search is enabled, users search for listings by searching for a specific place, like a country, city, or street. 

You can find out more [here about the search feature settings](LINK TO SEARCH SETTINGS ARTICLE). 

## Search page layout and filters

Your search page (where results from a search appear) can show listings in map view or grid view. You can learn more about these options in this article. 

On the search page, users can sort and filter their results. You can create sort and filter options from the listing fields you ask providers to fill out. [Read more about filters in this article](LINK TO FILTER ARTICLE).
