Filters can be used to give a better discovery experience to your users.
As your listing offering grows, it will become harder for your users to
find exactly what they’re looking for on the marketplace. The right use
of filters can significantly increase the browsing experience and your
marketplace usage.

There are several places where you can control filters. You can control
how filters are displayed and what filters are used in your marketplace.

## How to add filters to your marketplace

There are two types of filters that can be added to your marketplace.
Filters for default fields and filters for custom fields.

Fields for default fields can be controlled from the [Listing Search
settings of your Console account](LINK to the Listing search page).

You can enable Date range filters and a Price filter. Read more about
[how the default filters work](LINK to this page: Listings - Listing
Search - Listing search settings) .

Filters for custom listing fields can be controlled within the Listing
field settings. When you create a field. Filters can only be created for
“Select one” and “Select multiple” Listing field types. You can then
define if the filter is a primary or a secondary filter.

Primary filter: It will be displayed before all the other default
filters in the search page. Secondary filter: It will be displayed after
the default filters. In the map view it is only visible within the “More
filters” menu in the Map Layout view.

## How do filters work in the search page?

Filters can be a bit complex to understand. These section explains how
the custom field filters work. Date range filters explanation can be
found in [the Listing settings article](LINK TO Listings - Listing
Search - Listing search settings).

If a filter is created for a Select one type of field, the filter will
display all listings that have any of the selected options. (OR type of
filter)

If a filter is created for a Select multiple type of field, the filter
will only display listings that all of the selected options. (AND type
of filter)

## How to define how filters look in the search page?

You can define how filters are displayed in the search page, via [the
Search page Layout settings](Link to Layout - Difference between Search
Page Layout)
