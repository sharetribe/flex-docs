![Template in Sketch](./template-sketch.png)

The Sharetribe Web Template designs are available as Sketch files. The
design files include complete designs for the template desktop and
mobile views, as well as wireframes for the template desktop. You can
use these files as the basis for your own designs. This approach can
dramatically speed up the design process, and it offers an easy starting
point for the developers.

## Wireframes

Wireframes are an excellent tool to design your marketplace at the
structural level. They are most often used to arrange content and
functionality and establish the basic structure of a page before moving
on to designing visual elements. Wireframes for our desktop layout are
available as Sketch files below.

## Design files

The template is provided in desktop and mobile layouts. The designs are
provided as .sketch files, which can be opened using the
[Sketch vector graphics editor](https://www.sketch.com/). Some other
design tools such as Adobe XD and Photoshop also offer support for
designs in the .sketch file format.

Once you have the design files installed, you can start working on
customizing the design to match the visual identity of your marketplace.
Not only should you concentrate on how your marketplace should look
like, but also on what kind of user interfaces are required for your
users to interact with each other.

If you don't want to do the design work yourself, you can always hire a
designer to do it for you. If you don't know any designers,
[contact Sharetribe support](mailto:flex-support@sharetribe.com) and
we'll connect you to a designer who can help you out.

## Assets

Access the design resources in our
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sharetribe/design-resources).

The design files can be used according to
[Creative Commons licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
The files can also be opened with Adobe XD and Figma. The font used is
Poppins, which can be downloaded through
[Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/poppins) or through
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins).
