The Sharetribe Web Template designs are available as Sketch and Figma
files. The files include the complete designs for the template, allowing
you to visualize and better understand how the various components fit
together. These files are the starting point for your custom marketplace
design and using them can dramatically speed up your design process.

## Design files

We created the design files in [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and
[Figma](https://www.figma.com). You might need to download the Inter
font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) and
the SF Pro font from [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/).

Once you have the design files installed, you can start working on
customizing the design to match the visual identity of your marketplace.
Not only should you concentrate on how your marketplace should look but
also on what kind of user interfaces are required for your users to
interact with each other.

If you do not want to do the design work yourself, you can always hire a
designer to do it for you. If you don't know any designers, contact
[Sharetribe support](mailto:hello@sharetribe.com), and we'll connect you
to a designer who can help you. The design files are under the
[Creative Commons licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
