##### [Download the design files here](https://github.com/sharetribe/design-resources)

The Sharetribe Web Template designs are available as Sketch files. The
files include the complete designs for the template in desktop and
mobile views, allowing you to visualize and better understand how the
various components fit together. These files are the starting point for
your custom marketplace design and using them can dramatically speed up
your design process.

## Design files

Access the design resources in our
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sharetribe/design-resources). The
design files are under the
[Creative Commons licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
You will also need to download the Inter font, which you can download
through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter). We
offer the design files as .sketch files, which you can open using
[Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and some other digital design tools,
such as Adobe XD or Figma.

Once you have the design files installed, you can start working on
customizing the design to match the visual identity of your marketplace.
Not only should you concentrate on how your marketplace should look but
also on what kind of user interfaces are required for your users to
interact with each other.

If you do not want to do the design work yourself, you can always hire a
designer to do it for you. If you don't know any designers, contact
Sharetribe support, and we'll connect you to a designer who can help
you.
