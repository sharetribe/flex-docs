Saunatime Flex Template for Web (FTW) designs are available as Sketch
files. The design files include complete designs for FTW desktop and
mobile, as well as wireframes for FTW desktop. You can use these files
as the basis for your own designs. This approach can dramatically speed
up the design process, and it offers an easy starting point for the
developers.

## Wireframes

Wireframes are an excellent tool to design your marketplace at the
structural level. They are most often used to arrange content and
functionality and establish the basic structure of a page before moving
on to designing visual elements. Wireframes for our desktop layout are
available as Sketch files below.

## Design files

Sharetribe offers two templates: one for daily bookings (e.g. booking
saunas or hiking tours) and one for hourly bookings (e.g. booking yoga
lessons or renting kayaks). The main difference between these templates
is in the booking calendar, but also the outlooks differ to show some of
the flexibility that Flex offers. Both templates are provided in desktop
and mobile layouts. The designs are provided as .sketch files, which can
be opened using the
[Sketch vector graphics editor](https://www.sketch.com/). Some other
design tools such as Adobe XD and Photoshop also offer support for
designs in the .sketch file format.

Once you have the design files installed, you can start working on
customising the design to match the visual identity of your marketplace.
Not only should you concentrate on how your marketplace should look
like, but also on what kind of user interfaces are required for your
users to interact with each other.

If you don't want to do the design work yourself, you can always hire a
designer to do it for you. If you don't know any designers,
[contact Sharetribe support](mailto:flex-support@sharetribe.com) and
we'll connect you to a designer who can help you out.
