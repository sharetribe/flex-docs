## What are User Journeys?

// TODO: CA will update

User journey mapping is a simple but powerful tool that helps you
understand and plan how users interact with your marketplace and how
they will do business on your marketplace. The User Journey maps the
distinct steps a user must take to accomplish a certain goal - for
example, booking a yoga lesson.

Building your custom marketplace starts with defining the user journey
through your marketplace; how providers and customers use your
marketplace illustrates the platform youâ€™re building.

_Customer (buyer) - A user who registers to a marketplace to make
purchases._

_Provider (seller) - A user who sells or rents their products or
services on a marketplace._

## The User Journeys for Flex Templates

The Flex User Journeys will introduce you to the three different
marketplace templates - Saunatime, Yogatime and Sneakertime - and their
User Journeys.

[Flex Templates for Web](/operator-guides/concepts/#flex-templates-for-web-ftw)
are the starting point for building your custom marketplace with Flex.
There are three templates from which you can choose the one closest to
your marketplace idea. The templates are open-sourced website
applications that developers can modify per your unique requirements.
The result is a custom-built marketplace without the cost or time
required to build it from scratch.
