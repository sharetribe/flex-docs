## What are user journeys?

User journey mapping is a simple process that helps you understand and
plan how users interact with your marketplace and how they will do
business on your marketplace. An effective user journey maps the
distinct steps a user must take to accomplish a certain goal - for
example, buying a bike - and what other options are available to them,
like cancelling or leaving a review.

Building your custom marketplace starts with defining the user journey
through your marketplace; how providers and customers use your
marketplace illustrates the platform youâ€™re building.

_Customer (buyer) - A user who registers to a marketplace to make
purchases._

_Provider (seller) - A user who sells or rents their products or
services on a marketplace._

## The Template user journeys

Marketplace development on Sharetribe begins with the Sharetribe Web
Template. Developers download this codebase, then modify it to create
custom marketplaces. The existing codebase can save developers lots of
time. It can also make it a lot easier to create your user journeys
because that Template codebase already contains prebuilt journeys for a
variety of must-have marketplace features, such as signup, listing
creation, search, purchasing, reviews, seller onboarding, and more.

Creating a free Sharetribe account and visiting your Test environment is
the best way to see how the Template works. There you can access the
Template and use it as a real user, creating accounts, making
transactions, sending messages, and so on. If you're familiar with Figma
or other design tools, you can also download, view, and modify the
[design files](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/design-toolkit/design-files/)
showing all the screens in the Template.

The workflows you pursue in the Template represent the out of the box
features available in Sharetribe. Developers can use them as they are,
modify them, or completely remove (or add) functionality from this
starting point. A great way then to describe the requirements of your
marketplace are as modifications, tweaks, or sweeping changes to the
existing functionality.

In the
[next article](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/design-toolkit/your-user-journey-a-guide/),
we will share more about how to organize, describe, and share your user
journeys.
