## What are User Journeys?

User journey mapping is a simple but powerful tool that helps you
understand and plan how users interact with your marketplace and how
they will do business on your marketplace. The User Journey maps the
distinct steps a user must take to accomplish a certain goal - for
example, booking a yoga lesson.

Building your custom marketplace starts with defining the user journey
through your marketplace; how providers and customers use your
marketplace illustrates the platform you’re building.

_Customer (buyer) - A user who registers to a marketplace to make
purchases._

_Provider (seller) - A user who sells or rents their products or
services on a marketplace._

## The User Journeys for Flex Templates

The Flex User Journeys will introduce you to the three different
marketplace templates - Saunatime, Yogatime and Sneakertime - and their
User Journeys.

[Flex Templates for Web](/operator-guides/concepts/#flex-templates-for-web-ftw)
are the starting point for building your custom marketplace with Flex.
There are three templates from which you can choose the one closest to
your marketplace idea. The templates are open-sourced website
applications that developers can modify per your unique requirements.
The result is a custom-built marketplace without the cost or time
required to build it from scratch.

[Saunatime](/design-toolkit/user-journey-saunatime/) is a great starting
point for building rental marketplaces. Saunatime providers list saunas
for rent by day. Sauna lovers can search saunas by location and book
saunas by day using an availability calendar.

[Yogatime](/design-toolkit/user-journey-yogatime/) is a marketplace for
service providers–in this example case Yoga teachers–to create profile
listings advertising their teaching practice. Customers can book hourly
sessions from these teachers’ availability calendars. Since Yogatime
uses time based availability, rather than day based availability like
Saunatime, it is also a good starting point for marketplaces where
bookings are made with time units smaller than days.

[Sneakertime](/design-toolkit/user-journey-sneakertime/) is designed to
be a starting point for marketplaces where products are bought and sold.
Sellers list their products–in this case sneakers–and manage inventory
and fulfilment. Customers find, purchase, and review sneakers and
sellers.
