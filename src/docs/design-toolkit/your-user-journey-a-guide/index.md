Creating a user journey lets you communicate how your marketplace will
work. You should define your marketplaceâ€™s user journeys in preparing to
hire developers. Specifying to Flex development partners how providers
create listings, how users find listings, and how they interact together
during a transaction lets you receive more accurate estimates of the
budget required to build your custom marketplace with Flex.

In
[the previous article](/design-toolkit/what-are-user-journeys/#the-user-journeys-for-flex-templates),
you learned how listing creation, listing discovery, and the transaction
process works in one of the Flex Templates. Now it is time to define how
users complete these critical journeys on your marketplace.

## 1. Background work

Pick one of the three processes (listing creation, discovery process,
transaction process) to start with. Think through all the steps that
your users need to go through while using your marketplace in this
journey.

#### Listing creation

Focus on defining how users signup and create listings on your
marketplace. Consider these questions:

- How do users sign up? What information do you want to collect? Are
  there additional security measures to signing up?
- Do you want to internally label people as providers and/or customers
  at signup and show them different views after?
- Is the provider an individual person or a company?
- What information do you require in a listing?
- Do providers offer an availability calendar for bookings? Are listings
  booked nightly, daily, hourly, or some other way?
- How are listings priced? Is it tied to the booking length, or some
  other way?
- Does the listing need to be approved by the operator before being
  published?

#### Discovery process

Focus on illustrating how users search and find listings. Consider these
questions:

- Can the user browse the results before they have logged in?
- What is the main criteria the customer will use for searching:
  Location, availability, or a keyword?
- What filters are used to narrow the search results?
- In what order are the search results shown? Should the user be able to
  adjust the sorting criteria?
- What information is shown for each listing in the search view? How
  about in the listing view?

#### Transaction process

Focus on defining how your users transact on the marketplace. Starting
from the listing page, depict the steps from request to successful
completion. Consider these questions:

- What information should the customer provide when making a request?
- Should the provider accept each request, or are they approved
  automatically?
- Can customers propose prices as part of requesting a booking? Or, is
  the price fixed?
- When do you collect payment from the customer?
- Is the money transferred to the service provider before or after they
  have provided the service? Is there a need to delay the payout for
  some time to allow time for resolving possible conflicts or
  complaints?
- What is the cancellation and refund policy?
- How do reviews work? Do both parties review each other after a
  booking, or something else?
- What email notifications are sent as part of the transaction process?
  When are they sent?

## 2. Create maps for listing creation journey, discovery journey and transaction process.

There are many ways to illustrate user journeys. You can draft using pen
and paper, a mind map software like Whimsical or Miro, or by simply
listing the steps in a document or Powerpoint. You can use our user
journey map toolkit to help. To help you to get started, you can
download our Powerpoint template for Saunatime user journeys, and use it
as a basis for drawing your own. Powerpoint templates can be edited in
Powerpoint, Key or Google Slides.

Start simple. The easiest way to start is to write the default
successful user journey first, and then add differing paths. Remember,
you can see the default User Journeys for Saunatime in this article.

## 3. Share the journey maps with developers

If you would like to hire vetted Flex developers, start either by
[booking a call](https://calendly.com/welcome-to-flex) with our team or
connect directly with Flex Experts through the
[Expert Directory](https://www.sharetribe.com/experts/).
