We learned about user journeys and how to use the Template to create
them to save time and money in
[a previous article](/design-toolkit/what-are-user-journeys/). Now it is
time to define how your users will use your marketplace.

## Background work

The 3 most important user journeys on any marketplace are how listings
are created, how listings are found via search, and how supply and
demand interacts to transact. In short, listing creation, discovery
process, and transaction process.

Defining all 3 is important eventually, but focus on 1 to start. The
easiest way to start is to write the default successful user journey
first, and then add differing paths. Keep it simple.

Here are some common points of consideration in each journey.

#### Listing creation

Focus on defining how users signup and create listings on your
marketplace. Consider these questions:

- How do users sign up? What information do you want to collect? Are
  there additional security measures to signing up?
- Do you want to internally label people as providers and/or customers
  at signup and show them different views after?
- Is the provider an individual person or a company?
- What information do you require in a listing?
- Do providers offer an availability calendar for bookings? Are listings
  booked nightly, daily, hourly, or some other way?
- How are listings priced? Is it tied to the booking length, or some
  other way?
- Does the listing need to be approved by the operator before being
  published?

#### Discovery process

Focus on answering how users search and find listings. Consider these
questions:

- Can the user browse the results before they have logged in?
- What is the main criteria the customer will use for searching:
  Location, availability, or a keyword?
- What filters are used to narrow the search results?
- In what order are the search results shown? Should the user be able to
  adjust the sorting criteria?
- What information is shown for each listing in the search view? How
  about in the listing view?

#### Transaction process

Focus on defining how your users transact on the marketplace. Starting
from the listing page, depict the steps from request to successful
completion. Consider these questions:

- What information should the customer provide when making a request?
- Should the provider accept each request, or are they approved
  automatically?
- Can customers propose prices as part of requesting a booking? Or, is
  the price fixed?
- When do you collect payment from the customer?
- Is the money transferred to the service provider before or after they
  have provided the service? Is there a need to delay the payout for
  some time to allow time for resolving possible conflicts or
  complaints?
- What is the cancellation and refund policy?
- How do reviews work? Do both parties review each other after a
  booking, or something else?
- What email notifications are sent as part of the transaction process?
  When are they sent?

## Create maps for listing creation journey, discovery journey and transaction process.

There are many ways to document your user journeys. You can draft using
pen and paper, a mind map software like Whimsical or Miro, or by simply
listing the steps in a document or Powerpoint.

As an example, we share here the journeys to a marketplace for renting
saunas daily, like an AirBnB for saunas. They are in Powerpoint format
([download them here](/flex-design-toolkit.pptx)), which you can edit in
any similar software like Google Slides or Key. Creating something like
this will help developers quickly grasp what your marketplace is about
and help them move forward developing it.
