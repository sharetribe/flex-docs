[Sneakertime template](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUpxn_K4Mm8) is designed to be a starting point for marketplaces where products are bought and sold. Sellers list their products–in this case sneakers–and manage inventory and fulfilment. Customers find, purchase, and review sneakers and sellers. 

Sneakertime, as any typical marketplace, has three distinct user journeys: 
- **Search**: Search happens when customers search for listings on the marketplace using some combination of keywords, availability, filters, and sorting.
- **Listing creation**: Listings are created by providers to promote a product or service they are offering, with the exception of reverse marketplaces where the customer creates listings. What information providers enter into a listing, such a price or category, is usually the basis for the customer’s search experience.
- **Transactions**: The transaction process determines how a customer and providers interact on the marketplace, whether it is to rent, sell or interact otherwise.


In this article we’ll explore in depth how search, listing creation, and transactions work in Sneakertime. 
	

## Search Journey 

The search journey defines how users search and find product listings in your marketplace. Starting on the landing page, users progressively narrow their search to find the service, rental, or product they need. Users might find what they need by searching nearby locations or via keywords. Results should be filtered by relevant criteria, like price or category.

## Listing Creation Journey 

Sellers create listings to show what they are offering on the marketplace.. Listings can advertise services, products, or rentals, or, in reverse marketplaces, they are jobs providers apply to. The information collected in a listing typically influences what parameters are available during the search journey. The unit of value that is listed also influences how a transaction journey should progress.

## Transaction Process 

The transaction process defines how booking or buying events happen between the listing provider and the purchasing customer. Sharetribe Flex lets you extensively customize the rules and steps of your transaction process to govern how providers and customers capitalize on your marketplace.
