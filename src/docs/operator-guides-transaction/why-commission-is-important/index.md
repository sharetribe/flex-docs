The marketplace commission is the fee you charge for every payment users make through your marketplace. Most marketplace platforms monetize by charging commissions from transactions that occur on the platform. 

Ideally, the commission should cover the costs of running your marketplace, which, for example, includes Stripe’s processing fees and, eventually, even account for part of your marketplace profit. This means that to monetize from commissions, it’s essential to facilitate transactions on the marketplace. 

## Provider Commission

The provider commission is a fixed or percentage fee that’s taken from the listing price. It’s paid by the seller, and it goes to the marketplace.

### Example

Let’s set the provider commission as 10%. If the listing price is $60, then the seller commission of 10% is used. This means that the buyer pays a total of $60. The marketplace gets $6, and the seller gets $56.
