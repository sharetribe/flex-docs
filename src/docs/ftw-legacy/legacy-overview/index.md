## Deprecated templates

The Sharetribe Web Template replaces three separate templates that were
previously used for daily bookings (ftw-daily), product purchases
(ftw-product), and hourly bookings (ftw-hourly). The new template
combines the functionality of these three templates, allowing you to
configure it for either product bookings or hourly and daily bookings by
making simple changes to the configuration files. If you are starting to
develop a marketplace, we recommend that you start with the Sharetribe
Web Template. If you have already started development on one of the
previous templates, you can still use it with Sharetribe, but the legacy
templates will no longer be maintained. If you use a legacy template,
you can still contact Sharetribe's support team for assistance. In
addition, all documentation will still be available for the legacy
templates.

Read more about the new Sharetribe Web Template in the introduction
article and refer to the legacy documentation here.

## Migrating to Sharetribe Web Template

The new Sharetribe Web Template provides a single, unified platform that
can be configured to support either product bookings or hourly and daily
bookings, depending on the needs of your marketplace. If you have
already built your marketplace on a previous template, it may not be
worth migrating to the new template because the code changes are
extensive. However, if you are just starting to develop a marketplace,
it is recommended that you use the new template.

To view the changes introduced in the new template, you can review the
pull request for the update. This will give you a detailed look at the
specific changes and updates that have been made.
