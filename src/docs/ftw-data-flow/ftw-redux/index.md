## What is Redux

FTW is JavaScript single-page application (SPA). This means that the app
needs to be able to render several different layouts (pages) depending
on user interaction. State management is essential for this process. FTW
needs to know if a user has been authenticated, if it has received
relevant data for the current page, and so on.

We use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) for
state management on the application level. You should read more about
Redux before you start modifying queries to Flex API or creating new
Page level elements (unless you are modifying
[a static page](/ftw/how-to-add-static-pages-in-ftw/)).

In the following subtopics, we assume that you know the
[basics of Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/basic-tutorial) already.

## Containers: Pages + TopbarContainer

We have set up FTW so that pages are aware of Redux state store, but
other components and forms are purely
[presentational components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0).
This makes it easier to customize UI components - you don't need to be
aware of the complexity related to Redux setup when you just want to
touch the behavior of some visual component. In those cases, you can
just head to `src/components/` directory and you can see from there what
props are available for each component when they are rendered.
(FTW-daily and FTW-hourly use also `src/forms/` directory.)

Naturally, there is a need for higher level components which fetch new
data and define what props are passed down to presentational components.
In Redux terminology, those components are called _Containers_. FTW has
defined all the containers inside a directory called `src/containers/`.
It contains all the pages and a special container for top bar
(TopbarContainer) since that is a very complex component and it is
shared with almost every page. You can read more about differences
between presentational and container components from an
[article written by Dan Abramov](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)

The actual container setup of a page level component can be found from
the bottom of the component file. For example,
`src/containers/TransactionPage/TransactionPage.js` connects itself to
Redux store with `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` functions:

```js
const TransactionPage = compose(
  connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps),
  injectIntl
)(TransactionPageComponent);
```

## Duck files

Inside `src/containers/<ComponentName>` directory, we have also a
special `<ComponentName>.duck.js` file. These files wrap all the other
page-specific Redux concepts into a single file. Instead of writing
action types, action creators and reducers in separate files (and spread
them around our directory structure), FTW tries to keep pages
encapsulated. Page specific actions, store updates, and data fetches
happen inside their respective directory - just look for a file which
name follows a pattern: `<ComponentName>.duck.js`. This pattern is just
a simple concept of adding related things into a single file. Read more
from
[author's repository](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux).

### Global reducers

Some reducers are needed in several pages. These global reducers we have
defined inside `src/ducks/` directory with their respective `*.duck.js`
files. Most important global duck files are `user.duck.js` and
`marketplaceData.duck.js`.

## Setting up Redux

Container specific reducers are gathered and exported inside
`src/containers/reducers.js` file and global reducers are exported
respectively in a file `src/ducks/index.js`.

With those exports, we are able to create appReducer
(`src/reducers.js`):

```js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import * as globalReducers from './ducks';
import * as pageReducers from './containers/reducers';

const appReducer = combineReducers({
  ...globalReducers,
  ...pageReducers,
});
```

`appReducer` is called by `createReducer` function, which is called
inside of `configureStore` function (in `src/store.js`).

This setup creates a store structure that separates container specific
state as well as global data by their reducer names. Together with Ducks
module naming schema, this means that:

- the state of the `ListingPage` can be found from `state.ListingPage`
  and
- the state of the global `user` object can be found from `state.user`.

## Advanced Redux concepts: thunks

One essential part of state management in FTW, is filling the Redux
store with data fetched from the Flex API. This is done with
[Redux Thunks](https://redux.js.org/advanced/async-actions#async-action-creators),
which is a Redux middleware to create asynchronous action creators.

As with every other Redux store actions, we have defined Thunks inside
`*.duck.js` file. For example, fetching listing reviews can be done with
a following thunk function:

```js
export const fetchReviews = listingId => (dispatch, getState, sdk) => {
  // Make store aware of a request to fetch reviews
  dispatch(fetchReviewsRequest);
  // Fetch reviews using Flex SDK
  return sdk.reviews
    .query({
      listingId,
      state: 'public',
      include: ['author', 'author.profileImage'],
      'fields.image': ['variants.square-small'],
    })
    .then(response => {
      const reviews = denormalisedResponseEntities(response);
      // If fetch succeeds, make store aware of fetched data
      dispatch(fetchReviewsSuccess(reviews));
    })
    .catch(e => {
      // If fetch throws an error, save the error to the store (so that UI can react to it)
      dispatch(fetchReviewsError(storableError(e)));
    });
};
```

> Note: `sdk` parameter is also provided by Redux Thunk. We pass it to
> middleware in store.js: `thunk.withExtraArgument(sdk)`
