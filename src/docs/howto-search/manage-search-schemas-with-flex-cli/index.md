  This tutorial shows you how to manage extended data search schemas
  with Flex CLI. With search schemas in place, you can use custom
  extended data fields as filters in your queries.

Flex CLI (Command-line interface) is a tool for changing your
marketplace's advanced configurations such as transaction processes and
email templates.

This tutorial expects that you have already installed Flex CLI and are
logged in with your API key. If not, it's recommended to first read the
tutorial
[Getting started with Flex CLI](/introduction/getting-started-with-flex-cli/).

In this tutorial, we will add data schemas for the `category` and
`equipped-with` public data fields in listings. New marketplaces don't
have any schemas in the backend by default since the needs of
marketplaces vary. However, Sharetribe Web Template does define filters
for `category` and `equipped-with` in its UI (user interface). This
tutorial will make those filters work as expected.

We will also see how to manage data schema for user profiles. Those
schemas are not required for FTW to work, but can be useful when
building own integrations via the Flex Integration API.

## Extended data types and schema scopes

There are [various types of extended data](/references/extended-data/).
Search schema is scoped to a particular type of extended data and the
support differs depending on whether the schema is defined for listings
or user profiles. The following table summarizes the supported search
schema scopes.

| Schema for  | Supported scopes                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| listing     | public, metadata                     |
| userProfile | public, private, protected, metadata |

<info>

There is no API endpoint for querying users in the Marketplace API, so
`userProfile` search schema applies only to the
[/users/query endpoint in the Integration API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/integration.html#query-users).

</info>

All types of extended data are editable in Console by the operator, but
only public data and metadata can be seen by other marketplace users. To
see more details about extended data, see the
[Extended data](/references/extended-data/) reference.

You can store any JSON data in extended data, but only top-level keys of
certain type can have search schemas. If there is a mismatch between the
defined schema and what is stored to the extended data, the indexing
just skips those values.

## Schema types and cardinalities

| Type       | Cardinality | Example data                                                                                     | Example query                                                                      |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| enum       | one         | `category: "electric-bikes"`                                                                     | `pub_category=electric-bikes,city-bikes`                                           |
| multi-enum | many        | `equipped-with: ["bell", "lights"]`                                                              | `pub_equipped-with=has_all:bell,lights` or `pub_equipped-with=has_any:bell,lights` |
| boolean    | one         | `hasPannierRack: true`                                                                           | `pub_hasPannierRack=true`                                                          |
| long       | one         | `manufactureYear: 2021`                                                                          | `pub_manufactureYear=2020,2023`                                                    |
| text       | one         | `accessoriesDescription: "Pannier bags and a dog carrier (max 18 pounds) available on request."` | `keywords=bags%20dog%20carrier`                                                    |

<info>

Data schema of type `text` is currently only supported for listings.

</info>

Note that the scope in the examples above is `public`. Please use the
correct prefix depending on the scope of the data (`meta_` for metadata,
`priv_` for private data, `prot_` for protected data and `pub_` for
public data). Also, it's worth noting that the query parameter with a
`text` schema is `keywords` which also targets the `title` and
`description` attributes of a listing. This query parameter is only
supported in listing queries. See
[Keyword search](/concepts/how-the-listing-search-works/#keyword-search)
for more information.

### Providing multiple query params for a single field

You can provide multiple values in the query parameter by separating
those with a comma. The matching behavior is different for different
schema types.

With the `enum` type like the category above, when you query
`pub_category=electric-bikes,city-bikes`, you will match listings with
either "electric-bikes" OR "city-bikes" as the category. With the
`multi-enum`, you can control the matching mode explicitly. The query
`pub_equipped-with=has_all:bell,lights` will match listings with "bell"
AND "lights" in the equipped-with whereas the query
`pub_equipped-with=has_any:bell,lights` will match listings with either
"bell" OR "lights" (or both). If you don't specify the match mode in the
query (i.e. `pub_equipped-with=bell,lights`), by default we use the
has_all mathing mode (AND) for multi enums.

With the `text` type, you provide a search query, so splitting values
with a comma doesn't make sense. You will just provide a string of text
as the search query, and the query will be used as described
[in the keyword search explanation](/concepts/how-the-listing-search-works/#keyword-search)
section.

With the `long` type, you can provide minimum and/or maximum values for
the filtering.

For the full query reference, see the
[/listings/query](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html#query-listings)
endpoint API reference.

## Adding listing search schemas

Sharetribe Web Template defines several search filters in listing public
data, and two of them are `category` and `equipped-with`. A category is
something that is selected from a dropdown of options, so the schema
type should be `enum`. A listing can have multiple `equipped-with`
attributes that are also selected from a set of options and stored in an
array, so the schema type should be `multi-enum`.

Let's first see what search schemas we have defined:

```
$ flex-cli search -m my-marketplace-dev

Schema for   Scope   Key   Type   Default value   Doc

```

Let's add the search schemas for the category and equipped-with:

```
$ flex-cli search set --key category --type enum --scope public -m my-marketplace-dev
```

```
$ flex-cli search set --key equipped-with --type multi-enum --scope public -m my-marketplace-dev
```

We should now see the details for these new schemas:

```
$ flex-cli search -m my-marketplace-dev

Schema for   Scope   Key            Type        Default value   Doc
listing      public  equipped-with  multi-enum
listing      public  category       enum
```

Note that `--schema-for` option is not needed when adding schema for
`listing` as `listing` is the default.

If you wish to remove a schema, you can use the `search unset` command.

## Adding user search schema

<info>

Adding user search schemas is only supported in Flex CLI versions 1.10.0
and above. Use yarn to update Flex CLI by running
`yarn global upgrade flex-cli` or `npm update -g flex-cli` if you are
using npm.

</info>

User profile search schema can be useful, if you have an Integration API
application that needs to query different sets of users, depending on
some value in the user profile's extended data. For instance, if users
have `age` attribute stored in their protected data, you can use the
[/users/query endpoint in the Integration API](/references/extended-data/)
to find users of a certain age range.

Search schema for user profiles can be added as follows:

```
$ flex-cli search set --schema-for userProfile --key age --type long --scope protected -m my-marketplace-dev
```

The above adds a search schema for `userProfile` with `long` type for a
`key` named "age".

Querying the defined schemas now shows both the listing schemas added on
the previous step and the new user profile schema:

```
$ flex-cli search -m my-marketplace-dev

Schema for   Scope      Key           Type        Default value   Doc
listing      public     equipped-with multi-enum
listing      public     category      enum
userProfile  protected  age           long
```

If you wish to remove a schema, you can use the `search unset` command.

## Adding a search schema with a default value

Sometimes, you may want to query listings that do not have a certain
attibute set. For instance, you may have promoted listings on your
marketplace, labelled with a metadata attribute `isPromoted: true`. If
you only have a handful of promoted listings, you likely do not want to
tag all other listings with `isPromoted: false`.

Instead, Flex allows you to set a default value for the search schema â€“
all listings that do not have the attribute get returned when querying
the default value.

You can set the default value for a search schema simply by passing a
`--default` flag with the desired default value. To create the search
schema described above, the Flex CLI command is as follows:

```
$ flex-cli search set --key isPromoted --type boolean --scope metadata --default false -m my-marketplace-dev
```

Now, if we query all the search schemas on the marketplace, we can see
the default value for the `isPromoted` schema in the corresponding
column.

```
$ flex-cli search -m my-marketplace-dev

Schema for   Scope      Key             Type         Default value   Doc
listing      metadata   isPromoted      boolean      false
listing      public     equipped-with   multi-enum
listing      public     category        enum
userProfile  protected  age             long
```

## Summary

In this guide, we used Flex CLI to define search schemas for our
marketplace. We used the listing `category` and `equipped-with` as
examples, as the template expects those. In addition, we looked at
adding user search schemas for Integration API as well as adding a
listing schema with a default value.
