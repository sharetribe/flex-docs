## What are we building?

In this tutorial, we start to customize FTW-daily template and turn it
into a cottage-rental marketplace called CottageDays.

The first part of this tutorial is about branding the template. However,
we will add new articles later about features that go beyond FTW-daily
template and its default behaviour.

**Part 1: Branding**<br /> Learn to make changes that are necessary to
turn Saunatime marketplace to CottageDays marketplace. At the end of
this part, we deploy CottageDays marketplace to Heroku.

**Part 2: Extend the data model**<br /> Learn how to extend listing
entity with marketplace specific data. Then we show the new info on
listing page and we also add a search filter for it.

**Part 3: Modifying the transaction process**<br /> Here, we start by
showing how to customize the pricing. Then the rest of the articles are
more focused on making modifications to the transaction process and
email notifications.

## Prerequisites

FTW-daily is created on top of [React](https://reactjs.org/),
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/), and styles are creted with
[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). You should be
familiar with those libraries.

You should also have completed the
[Getting started guide](/introduction-getting-started/getting-started-with-ftw-daily/)
and as a result, you have the FTW-daily repository cloned to your local
development environment and the app is available in
http://localhost:3000.

After that you could set up a Github repository for code changes. You
could either
_[Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository)
the FTW-daily repository_ or
_[create your own Github repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)_
and push your locally cloned Git repository there.

Even though the first option is easier (i.e. just click the "fork"
button in FTW-daily Github repo), the latter is the recommended approach
for the actual customization work. Here's a rough guide on how to set it
up:

1. Create a
   [Github repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo).

   > **Note**: do not initialize the repo with anything. You are
   > importing an existing repository.

1. On the command line, check your remote repositories:

   ```shell
   git remote -v
   ```

   It should print this:

   ```shell
   origin  https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily.git (push)
   ```

1. Rename the FTW-daily repository (current '_origin_') as '_upstream_'

   ```shell
   git remote rename origin upstream
   ```

   <extrainfo title="Check what your remote repositories should print at this point">

   Check your remote repositories:

   ```shell
   git remote -v
   ```

   It should print this:

   ```shell
   upstream  https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily.git (fetch)
   upstream  https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily.git (push)
   ```

   </extrainfo>

1. Add your newly created repository as '_origin_':

   ```shell
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-account>/<the-name-of-your-new-repo>.git
   ```

   <extrainfo title="Check what your remote repositories should print at this point">

   Check your remote repositories:

   ```shell
   git remote -v
   ```

   It should print something like this:

   ```shell
   origin  https://github.com/<your-github-account>/<the-name-of-your-new-repo>.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/<your-github-account>/<the-name-of-your-new-repo>.git (push)
   upstream  https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily.git (fetch)
   upstream  https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily.git (push)
   ```

   </extrainfo>

1. Rename your local default branch as **main**

   If you have cloned _FTW-daily_ or _FTW-hourly_ repository, the
   default branch is following an old Github naming pattern.

   ```shell
   git checkout master
   git branch -m master main
   ```

   _FTW-product_ uses the new naming pattern - you just need to checkout
   the correct branch.

   ```shell
   git checkout main
   ```

1) Push an existing repository from the command line

   ```shell
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   <extrainfo title="What's the difference between master and main?">

   [Git](https://git-scm.com/about) is one of the most popular version
   control systems. It creates a tree structure where each **commit**
   (of code changes) creates a new node in that tree. The default branch
   (trunk) has been traditionally called as **master**, but
   [Github](https://github.com/about) has moved away from that naming
   convention and has started to call the default branch as **main**.

   FTW-daily and FTW-hourly have been created long time before that
   naming convention changed, so they still use **master** as the name
   of the default branch. However, Github is pushing the new naming
   convention into use throughout their service and it's better if new
   repositories follow that naming pattern.

Now you are ready to make code changes and save those to Github!
