The goal of this tutorial is to help you build a marketplace using a
self-hosted version of the Sharetribe Web Template. You will learn how
to set up a self-hosted marketplace and how to start working on
development using the Sharetribe Web Template. Before you begin, we
recommend you complete the non-technical tutorial **[TODO: Link to
introduction of the non-technical tutorial]** to see what you can
achieve using the no-code UIs in Console.

## What are we building?

In this tutorial, we will start editing the Sharetribe Web Template and
turn it into a Sauna rental marketplace called Saunatribe.

The first part of this tutorial focuses on setting up the self-hosted
template, making minor changes to the template styles and deploying a
development environment. The second part dives deeper into modifying the
listing creation process, and the third part focuses on editing the
transaction process.

## Background knowledge

The first part of the tutorial is accessible even though you are brand
new to web development. Parts two and three increase in difficulty, and
it helps to have some background in web development.

Before you start working on the tutorial, it's good to understand a few
key concepts (a general understanding of the fundamentals should
suffice, and you'll learn a lot throughout the tutorial).

- **The Sharetribe Web Template**: a template aimed as a starting point
  for developing your marketplace application on top of Sharetribe's
  APIs. The template provides you with a fully functional marketplace
  out of the box.

- **Self-hosted marketplace**: an instance of the Sharetribe Web
  Template that you host in the hosting environment of your choice (e.g.
  Heroku or Render), allowing you to customise and manage the code base
  freely.

- **Headless**: the marketplace client is decoupled from the marketplace
  backend. The client communicates with the backend via API. You can
  manage configurations, assets and pages in Console, and your client
  can access them using the Asset Delivery API.

- **Marketplace environment**: There are three marketplace environments:
  Test, Development, and Live (you can find these in Console). You can
  use the development environment to develop your marketplace and test
  environment as a preview or staging environment. Your Live marketplace
  is home to your actual live marketplace.

- **Flex CLI**: A command line tool that you can use to change your
  marketplace's advanced configurations, such as transaction processes
  and email templates

## Before starting the tutorial

Before continuing to the tutorial's first part, complete the
[Getting Started Guide](/introduction/getting-started-with-web-template/).
This guide will walk you through installing the template and setting up
your local development environment.

We also recommend that you create a GitHub repository for your new
marketplace. Using a GitHub repository allows you to keep track of
changes made to your code over time, making it easier to revert to
previous versions or compare different versions of your code. It also
enables collaboration among multiple developers working on the same
project, and provides a backup of your code in the cloud.

To create a GitHub repository, you will need to:

1. Create a
   [Github repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo).

   <info>

   Do not initialize the repo with anything. You are importing an
   existing repository.

   </info>

1. On the command line, check your remote repositories:

   ```shell
   git remote -v
   ```

   It should print this:

   ```shell
   origin  https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template.git (push)
   ```

1. Rename the Sharetribe Web Template repository (current '_origin_') as
   '_upstream_'

   ```shell
   git remote rename origin upstream
   ```

   <extrainfo title="Check what your remote repositories should print at this point">

   Check your remote repositories:

   ```shell
   git remote -v
   ```

   It should print this:

   ```shell
   upstream  https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template.git (fetch)
   upstream  https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template.git (push)
   ```

   </extrainfo>

1. Add your newly created repository as '_origin_':

   ```shell
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-account>/<the-name-of-your-new-repo>.git
   ```

   <extrainfo title="Check what your remote repositories should print at this point">

   Check your remote repositories:

   ```shell
   git remote -v
   ```

   It should print something like this:

   ```shell
   origin  https://github.com/<your-github-account>/<the-name-of-your-new-repo>.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/<your-github-account>/<the-name-of-your-new-repo>.git (push)
   upstream  https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template.git (fetch)
   upstream  https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template.git (push)
   ```

   </extrainfo>

1. Push an existing repository from the command line

   ```shell
   git push -u origin main
   ```

<info>

The examples above use HTTPS remote URLs instead of SSH remote
URLs.<br /> Read more about
[remote URLs](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/which-remote-url-should-i-use).

</info>

Now you are ready to make code changes and save them to Github!
