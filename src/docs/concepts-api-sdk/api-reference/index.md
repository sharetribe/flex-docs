## Introduction

**[Access the Sharetribe API reference here](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/)**

The Sharetribe API consists of the following individual APIs:

- [Marketplace API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html)
- [Integration API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/integration.html)
- [Authentication API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/authentication.html)
- [Asset Delivery API](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/asset-delivery-api.html)

All these are HTTP APIs and both the Integration API and Marketplace API
support [JSON](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7159.txt) and
[Transit](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format) formats. The
Authentication API is based on OAuth2. Our API documentation provides
further technical detail on all four APIs. If you are looking for a way
to use the APIs in your client or server application, refer to our
documentation on the
[SDK for JavaScript](https://sharetribe.github.io/flex-sdk-js/) or the
[Integration SDK for JavaScript](https://sharetribe.github.io/flex-integration-sdk-js/).

Integration API, refer to our article on
