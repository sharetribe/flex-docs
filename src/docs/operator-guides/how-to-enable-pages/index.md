This article explains only how to enable Pages in your marketplace. If
you want to learn how to use the feature, you can read the article about
[editing Pages in Console](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/operator-guides/how-to-edit-pages-in-console)

### For marketplaces created after 2023-02-14 (PAGES RELEASE DATE)

Log into the [Flex Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/).
Switch to the Demo environment. Choose the “Build” option from the top
bar, then select “Content”. Go to the any of the default pages to start
editing the corresponding page. When you make changes within the demo
environment, you will be able to see changes right away. If you want to
use the Pages feature in dev or production, you would need to do further
setup with some development.

### For marketplaces created before 2023-02-14 (PAGES RELEASE DATE)

If you created your Flex marketplace before Pages release, you can try
out Pages in your Demo environment by going to the home page of your
Demo environment and clicking the "Refresh demo" button. You can then
try editing them or creating new pages by navigating to "Build" and then
"Content".

Note that the above lets you test the Pages feature (and follow along
our Pages documentation, including this
[FAQ tutorial](CHANGEMECHANGEMECHANGEME), but it does not yet let you
make changes to your marketplace client app’s development or production
content pages. You will need to modify your custom marketplace’s code to
connect it to the new Pages feature. Contact your developer in order to
get this feature enabled.
