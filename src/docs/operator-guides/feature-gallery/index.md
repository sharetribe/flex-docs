The table below contains information about common features marketplaces
build with Sharetribe Flex. If you are not a developer, you need to hire
a developer like a Flex Expert to help you build your marketplace. Your
responsibility in this arrangement is to tell the developers how you
want your marketplace to work. Use this table to help you name
functionalities you want in your marketplace, understand their most
basic implementation on Flex, and learn what information to prepare for
your developer to build this feature.
