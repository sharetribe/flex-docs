Sharetribe Flex allows you to build a unique marketplace fast with
custom development. Unless you have
[these development skills](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/background/development-skills/),
you need to hire someone who does. Any developer will do, but we
recommend hiring a vetted developer from Sharetribe's official Flex
Partner Network to ensure a great price/quality ratio.

Hiring a developer to build your marketplace with Flex requires two
things. First communicating your requirements to the developer. Second,
matching your requirements to your budget, timeline, and what Flex
offers. The rest of the article will walk through these aspects.

### Defining custom requirements using the Flex Template

With Flex, you have full freedom to build a completely unique
marketplace. This means the developers you hire need guidance on how
exactly you want the marketplace to work.

We recommend using one of
[Flex Templates for Web](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/background/concepts/#flex-templates-for-web-ftw)
as a basis for the development work, especially if you're launching a
marketplace for the first time. The Flex Templates are examples of fully
functional marketplace applications. Typically the Templates have
80%-90% of the functionality you need already available, so you can
focus on your unique requirements, and save a lot of time and money.

Basing your customizations on the Flex Template requires understanding
what it offers. There are a few ways to gain this understanding:

1. Access the Saunatime demo via your
   [Flex Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/). Saunatime is
   one of the Flex Templates. The demo allows you to try out all the
   features of theFlex Template: searching, signing up as a new user,
   adding listings, making bookings and payments, sending messages,
   leaving reviews, and so on.
2. Study
   [how listing search, listing creation, and transactions work](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/design-toolkit/user-journey/)
   specifically.
3. Install one of the template applications (Saunatime or Yogatime)
   yourself following
   [this guide](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/introduction/getting-started-with-ftw-daily/),
   or ask a developer to do it for you.
4. If you're comfortable working with design software like Sketch, Adobe
   XD or Figma, you can download the complete
   [design files](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/design-toolkit/design-files/)
   of the two templates to explore all their pages and views.

Your developer’s job is to customize the Flex Template (how it looks and
how it works) to meet your unique requirements. Your responsibility is
to communicate these requirements to the developer.

When you meet with the developers, you should be able to explain to them
how your users create content (e.g what kind of information you collect
from them when they sign up or add a product or service on offer ), how
your users find this content (is there a search by location or by
keyword, what kind of categories and filters can be used when searching,
and so on), and how buyers and sellers transact (is there an online
payment, messaging, reviews, and so on). Whenever there's a difference
in what you see in the template and how you want your marketplace to
work, you need to communicate this to the developer. You can follow
[this guide](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/design-toolkit/your-user-journey-a-guide/)
for help.

You also need to communicate to the developers how the marketplace looks
visually. The fastest option is to follow the visual style of the Flex
Template. However, you might have a completely unique visual style in
mind. In this case, you either need to adjust the design files yourself
to communicate the visual style you want, or hire a designer to do this
work for you. Many Flex partners also offer design services you can
hire.

### The required budget

Using one of the Flex Templates as a basis, building a unique
marketplace concept typically requires at least 100 hours of
development.

At a rate of
$30 per hour (the hourly rates of Flex partners vary from $15 to
$100), this means building the first version of your marketplace would cost $3,000.
This is the absolute minimum budget you need to be prepared for.
However, in this scenario, your concept would need to require only
minimal adjustments to the templates, where you keep the user journeys
the same and focus only on changing the particulars: listing fields,
search filters, small changes to the transaction process, and branding.

More commonly development will take more hours, so an average budget
required to launch the first version of your platform tends to be around
\$10k.

The cost and time to develop your unique marketplace with Flex depends
heavily on your specific requirements in terms of features and budget.
What you are building and who you hire to build it are the biggest
determinants of the budget needed to build your marketplace.

The best way to get an accurate estimate of the time and budget required
to build your unique marketplace is to get in touch with developers.
With your requirements prepared, Sharetribe’s Flex partners can prepare
a high-level estimate for you fast. To get in touch with them, go to
your [Flex Console](https://flex-console.sharetribe.com/) and either
submit your requirements through a form provided there, or book a free
consultation call with one of Sharetribe's experts to discuss your
requirements.

### Building a marketplace the Sharetribe way

Building a marketplace platform is a process, not a project. As a
general rule, we recommend you to launch your first version (the
["Minimum Viable Platform"](https://www.sharetribe.com/academy/how-to-build-a-minimum-viable-platform/))
with as minimal a feature set as possible, in order to be able to launch
faster and validate your concept. We call this the Lean Marketplace
approach.

Once you start receiving feedback from your first users, it's a lot
easier to decide what to build next. As you grow, you should be prepared
to constantly adjust your platform and release new improvements to it.
Our recommendation is to reserve at least half of your development
budget for changes you're going to make during the first 12 months after
launching, instead of spending your entire budget pre-launch.
