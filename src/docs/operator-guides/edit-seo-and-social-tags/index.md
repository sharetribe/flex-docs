Meta tags are a fundamental part of any static content page. They
determine how social media platforms, browsers and search engines will
display your marketplace. Google, for example, uses your SEO metatags to
populate their search results page.

Each content page built with Pages has the following meta tags:

- Page title: This tag determines what is displayed in the browsers
  window and search engines search result titles.
- Page description: Sets the Description metadata. Search engines might
  use this tag to give more information about your page in their results
  page.
- Page title for social media: The page title used specifically when
  your site is shared in social media.
- Page description for social media: The page description used
  specifically when your site is shared in a social media.
- Social media image: The image that is uploaded is uploaded with
  original aspect page. Displayed when someone shares the page in social
  media. The image should have a 1.91:1 aspect ratio and a minimum size
  of 1200x630 pixels. If the image is bigger or has the wrong ratio it
  might get cropped by the social media engine.

Note that not all social media sites or search engines will display your
content the same way. The same is true for different search engine
platforms, for consistency, use the same text for the Page title and the
Social title. The same is true for the Page description and Social
description. Note that it may take a few days for search engines and
social media platforms to index your changes and in some cases there is
no way to alter or get them to index your content sooner.
