Every page has metadata that determines how search engines and social
media platforms will display it. Google, for example, uses the title and
description you set to your page to populate their search results page.

## Edit your metadata tags

When editing your content page, navigating to the "SEO & Social" tab
lets you alter its metadata tags. You can edit the following metadata
tags:

- Page title: This metadata tag determines what is displayed in the
  browsers window and search engines search result titles.
- Page description: Search engines might use this metadata tag's content
  to give more information about your page in their search results page.
- Page title for social media: The page title used specifically when
  your site is shared in social media.
- Page description for social media: The page description used
  specifically when your site is shared in a social media.
- Social media image: The image that is uploaded is uploaded with
  original aspect page. Displayed when someone shares the page in social
  media. The image should have a 1.91:1 aspect ratio and a minimum size
  of 1200x630 pixels. If the image is bigger or has the wrong ratio it
  might get cropped by the social media engine.

Note that not all social media sites will display your content the same
way. The same is true for different search engine platforms, even though
you have defined the content of these tags, search engines might ignore
it in favor of richer content in within your Pages. For consistency, use
the same text for both title tags. Try to use the same text for both
description texts and try to make it as useful and descriptive as
possible. Note that it may take a few days for search engines and social
media platforms to index your changes. With some sites, it is possible
to influence this time.
