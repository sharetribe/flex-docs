When working with Flex, you have the option to start development on top
of our
[Flex Templates for Web](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/ftw-introduction/how-to-customize-ftw/),
web applications built on top of the Marketplace API. You can also
develop your frontend application from scratch, but using one of our
templates can save considerable time.

Yogatime or FTW-hourly is a Flex Template with time-based availability,
built with service marketplaces in mind. Yogatime has three features
that set it apart from other Flex templates: hourly bookings, profiles
as bookable listings, and timezone support. You can learn more about it
in the video below. If you prefer reading, scroll past the video, and
read on instead! For more technical information on Yogatime, check out

## Hourly bookings

Yogatime’s default availability system is for hourly bookings on a
weekly schedule. Instead of day-based availability, you will have
time-based availability. Day-based availability is great for
marketplaces that offer rentals – think Airbnb, for example. Time-based
availability is vital for service marketplaces, where booking lengths
can be anything from minutes to hours.

Yogatime and hourly availability allow for more flexibility in
customizing booking lengths to your exact needs. The bookable timeslots
can be broken up into as short as 5-minute slots but also multiplied
into longer periods, such as a day or a month. You can also offer a
variety of different booking length options on the same marketplace.

## Profiles as bookable listings

In Flex, only listings can be searched and booked. In a service
marketplace, however, a listing should contain information about the
service provider as well.

To offer classes in Yogatime, yoga teachers first sign up on the
marketplace and then create a separate teacher profile. From the
software’s perspective, the teacher profile is a listing, but for your
customers, it offers information about the teacher they’re looking to
book – like a profile! In other words, a provider in Yogatime has:

1. A user profile where they can manage their personal information and
   private data such as payment details. Your buyers have user profiles
   as well.
2. A public profile listing where they offer services and where customer
   can book them.

Only the latter can be shown in search results.

A provider can only create one listing, which means that all their
bookings and availability management happen in the same place. With
custom development, you can still
[enable multiple listings per provider](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/ftw-introduction/ftw-hourly/#each-provider-can-have-only-one-listing).

## Timezone support

Yogatime has time zone support. The provider’s location determines the
timezone of the listing, and that timezone is saved into the listing’s
availability plan.

For example, if your marketplace has listings in two timezones, such as
in Finland and Sweden, customers in both countries can make bookings in
their own timezones and be sure that their clock matches the booking
time.

## Customizing your unique marketplace

Yogatime is just one example of a Flex marketplace, and you can use it
to build your unique marketplace. With Flex, you can customize
everything from the visual design of your platform to its transaction
processes, availability options, integrations, and much more.
