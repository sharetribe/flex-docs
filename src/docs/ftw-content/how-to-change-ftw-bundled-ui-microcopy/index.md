  This guide describes how to change the bundled microcopy in Flex
  Template for Web (FTW).

The Flex Template for Web supports having a single language for the UI.
Supported languages are English, French and Spanish, English being used
by default. For information about changing the language, see the
[Changing the language](/ftw/how-to-change-ftw-language/) article.

We use the [React Intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl) library to
represent UI microcopy and to format dates, numbers, and money values.

_**Note:** Starting in 2022-05, FTW template microcopy can also be
modified in Flex Console. If you want to implement this feature into
your pre-v8.5 FTW-daily template, you can see the necessary
modifications in the PR for
[ftw-daily](https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily/pull/1510). Read

In FTW-hourly, hosted microcopy is available in v10.5. In FTW-product, it is available in v9.2.

## The microcopy file

All the bundled microcopy can be found in the
[src/translations/en.json](https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily/blob/master/src/translations/en.json)
file. The microcopy data is formatted as one JSON object with all the
microcopy key-value pairs as properties.

The key - value syntax is as follows:

```json
"<component name>.<microcopy key>": "<message>"
```

For example:

```json
"ManageListingCard.viewListing": "View listing"
```

The keys are namespaced to the corresponding component. This is aligned
with the component driven paradigm that the application follows. It
might introduce duplication with same microcopy messages occurring
multiple times in the microcopy file. On the other hand, it also
emphasizes how all the components are independent, how a component can
be used anywhere, and how modifications to a single component do not
affect other components.

## Using the marketplace microcopy

React Intl provides multiple ways to access the microcopy data but the
most commonly used are the `formatMessage` function and the
`FormattedMessage` tag provided by React Intl.

To use the `formatMessage` function, component needs to be wrapped with
the `injectIntl` function which provides a render prop called `intl`.
`intl` then provides all the React Intl translation functions, like
`formatMessage`:

```js
import { intlShape, injectIntl } from 'react-intl';

const SomeComponent = props => {
  const { intl } = props;

  const translation = intl.formatMessage({
    id: 'SomeComponent.someKey',
  });

  // ...
};

SomeComponent.propTypes = {
  // from injectIntl
  intl: intlShape.isRequired,
};

export default injectIntl(SomeComponent);
```

As for the `FormattedMessage` it just needs to be imported from
`react-intl` and it takes the id prop:

```jsx
<FormattedMessage id="SomeComponent.someKey" />
```

Other functions and componets can be explored in the
[React Intl documentation](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki).

## Formatting

React Intl uses the [FormatJS](https://formatjs.io/) formatters for
shaping the microcopy messages based on given arguments. Here are a few
examples on how to use FormatJS.

### Arguments

Pass a named argument to the format function/component. For the
following microcopy message:

```json
"EnquiryForm.messageLabel": "Message to {authorDisplayName}",
```

Pass the author data in the `FormattedMessage` component:

```jsx
<FormattedMessage
  id="EnquiryForm.messageLabel"
  values={{ authorDisplayName: 'Jane D' }}
/>
```

Or the the `formatMessage` function:

```js
intl.formatMessage(
  { id: 'EnquiryForm.messageLabel' },
  { authorDisplayName: 'Jane D' }
);
```

### Pluralization

With pluralization, a microcopy message can be formatted to adapt to a
number argument.

```json
"ManageListingsPage.youHaveListings":
  "You have {count} {count, plural, one {listing} other {listings}}",
```

This message takes the `count` argument and uses the `plural`, `one` and
`other` keywords to format the last word of the microcopy message to be
_listing_ or _listings_ based on the `count`. The pluralized message can
be used with the `FormattedMessage` component:

```jsx
<FormattedMessage
  id="ManageListingsPage.youHaveListings"
  values={{ count: 3 }}
/>
```

Or with the `formatMessage` function:

```js
intl.formatMessage(
  { id: 'ManageListingsPage.youHaveListings' },
  { count: 1 }
);
```

### Select an option

If you have two or more options that the microcopy message needs to show
depending on another argument, you can use the `select` keyword to pass
the necessary information to the message.

When you use `select` in the microcopy message, you will need to specify

- the variable determining which option to use (here: `mode`)
- the pattern we are following (here: `select`)
- the options matching each alternative you want to specify (here:
  `class` â€“ there could be several options specified)
- an `other` option that gets used when none of the specified
  alternatives matches

```json
 "BookingBreakdown.description": "{mode, select, day {You are booking the following days:} night {You are booking the following nights:} other {You are booking the following {unitType}:}}"
```

You can then use the microcopy message in the code with the
`formatMessage` function:

```js
// mode: the types of bookings or products available
// on the listing page, e.g. class, package, day, night
const mode = 'class';
const unitType = 'yoga class'
// For { mode: 'class', unitType: 'yoga class' },
// the message will read "You are booking the following yoga class.".
const description = intl.formatMessage(
  { id="BookingBreakdown.description" },
  { mode, unitType }
);
```

You can also use the message with the `FormatMessage` component

```jsx
<FormattedMessage
  id="BookingBreakdown.description"
  values={{ mode: 'day' }}
/>
```

More formatting examples can be found from the
[FormatJS message syntax documentation](https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax/).
