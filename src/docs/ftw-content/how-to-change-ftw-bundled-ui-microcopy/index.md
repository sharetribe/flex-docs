The Sharetribe Web Template supports having a single language for the
UI. Supported languages are English, French and Spanish, English being
used by default. For information about changing the language, see the
[Changing the language](/template/how-to-change-template-language/)
article.

We use the [React Intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl) library to
represent UI marketplace texts and to format dates, numbers, and money
values.

In addition to bundled marketplace texts, Sharetribe allows modifying
marketplace texts through the Sharetribe Console:

- [Marketplace texts in Sharetribe](/concepts/marketplace-texts/)
- [How hosted marketpalace texts work in the template](/template/hosted-marketplace-texts/)

## The marketplace text file

All the bundled marketplace texts can be found in the
[src/translations/en.json](https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template/blob/master/src/translations/en.json)
file. The marketplace text data is formatted as one JSON object with all
the marketplace text key-value pairs as properties.

The key - value syntax is as follows:

```json
"<component name>.<marketplace text key>": "<message>"
```

For example:

```json
"ManageListingCard.viewListing": "View listing"
```

The keys are namespaced to the corresponding component. This is aligned
with the component driven paradigm that the application follows. It
might introduce duplication with same messages occurring multiple times
in the marketplace text file. On the other hand, it also emphasizes how
all the components are independent, how a component can be used
anywhere, and how modifications to a single component do not affect
other components.

## Using marketplace texts

React Intl provides multiple ways to access the marketplace text data,
but the most commonly used are the `formatMessage` function and the
`FormattedMessage` tag provided by React Intl.

To use the `formatMessage` function, component needs to be wrapped with
the `injectIntl` function which provides a render prop called `intl`.
`intl` then provides all the React Intl translation functions, like
`formatMessage`:

```js
import { intlShape, injectIntl } from 'react-intl';

const SomeComponent = props => {
  const { intl } = props;

  const translation = intl.formatMessage({
    id: 'SomeComponent.someKey',
  });

  // ...
};

SomeComponent.propTypes = {
  // from injectIntl
  intl: intlShape.isRequired,
};

export default injectIntl(SomeComponent);
```

As for the `FormattedMessage` it just needs to be imported from
`react-intl` and it takes the id prop:

```jsx
<FormattedMessage id="SomeComponent.someKey" />
```

Other functions and componets can be explored in the
[React Intl documentation](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki).

## Formatting

React Intl uses the [FormatJS](https://formatjs.io/) formatters for
shaping the messages based on given arguments. Here are a few examples
on how to use FormatJS.

### Arguments

Pass a named argument to the format function/component. For the
following message:

```json
"EnquiryForm.messageLabel": "Message to {authorDisplayName}",
```

Pass the author data in the `FormattedMessage` component:

```jsx
<FormattedMessage
  id="EnquiryForm.messageLabel"
  values={{ authorDisplayName: 'Jane D' }}
/>
```

Or the the `formatMessage` function:

```js
intl.formatMessage(
  { id: 'EnquiryForm.messageLabel' },
  { authorDisplayName: 'Jane D' }
);
```

### Pluralization

With pluralization, a message can be formatted to adapt to a number
argument.

```json
"ManageListingsPage.youHaveListings":
  "You have {count} {count, plural, one {listing} other {listings}}",
```

This message takes the `count` argument and uses the `plural`, `one` and
`other` keywords to format the last word of the message to be _listing_
or _listings_ based on the `count`. The pluralized message can be used
with the `FormattedMessage` component:

```jsx
<FormattedMessage
  id="ManageListingsPage.youHaveListings"
  values={{ count: 3 }}
/>
```

Or with the `formatMessage` function:

```js
intl.formatMessage(
  { id: 'ManageListingsPage.youHaveListings' },
  { count: 1 }
);
```

### Select an option

If you have two or more options that the message needs to show depending
on another argument, you can use the `select` keyword to pass the
necessary information to the message.

When you use `select` in the message, you will need to specify

- the variable determining which option to use (here: `mode`)
- the pattern we are following (here: `select`)
- the options matching each alternative you want to specify (here:
  `class` â€“ there could be several options specified)
- an `other` option that gets used when none of the specified
  alternatives matches

```json
 "BookingBreakdown.description": "{mode, select, day {You are booking the following days:} night {You are booking the following nights:} other {You are booking the following {unitType}:}}"
```

You can then use the message in the code with the `formatMessage`
function:

```js
// mode: the types of bookings or products available
// on the listing page, e.g. class, package, day, night
const mode = 'class';
const unitType = 'yoga class'
// For { mode: 'class', unitType: 'yoga class' },
// the message will read "You are booking the following yoga class.".
const description = intl.formatMessage(
  { id="BookingBreakdown.description" },
  { mode, unitType }
);
```

You can also use the message with the `FormatMessage` component

```jsx
<FormattedMessage
  id="BookingBreakdown.description"
  values={{ mode: 'day' }}
/>
```

More formatting examples can be found from the
[FormatJS message syntax documentation](https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax/).
