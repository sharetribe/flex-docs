Some aspects of the listing search, are set in the Listing fields, which
we touched on, in [the previous article of the tutorial](LINK TO THE
LISTING FIELDS]. To set the Listing search go to Build → Content →
Listing search.

## Search type

On the listing search page leave the search type as “Location search”.

## Date range filter

Check the option “Display a date range filter.” Select “Partial
availability” as the Availability mode Select “Daily availability”as the
Date range mode.

## Price filter

Check “Display a price filter” under Price filter. Set the price filter
minimum value to 20 and the maximum value as 1000.

## Save changes

Finally, we’ll save changes, and we’re done with our listing type,
field, and search configuration.

You can learn more about listing types, listing fields, and listing
search in our new console help articles here: LINK TO LISTING FIELDS and
LISTING SEARCH ARTICLES.
