Some aspects of the listing search, are set in the Listing fields, which we touched on, in [the previous article of the tutorial](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/pilot-day-guides/creating-listing-fields). To set the Listing search go to Build → Content → Listing search. 

## Search type
On the listing search page, leave the search type as “Location search”. 

## Date range filter
Check the option “Display a date range filter.” 
Select “Partial availability” as the Availability mode. 
Select “Daily availability”as the Date range mode. 

## Price filter
Check “Display a price filter” under Price filter. Set the price filter minimum value to 20 and the maximum value as 1000. 

## Save changes
Finally, we’ll save changes, and we’re done with our listing type, field, and search configuration.
