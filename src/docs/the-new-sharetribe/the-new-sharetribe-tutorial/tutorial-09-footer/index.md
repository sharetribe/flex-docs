The footer is an element displayed at the bottom of every page in your
marketplace website (except the search page, if you're using a map
layout). It typically contains lots of links that help your users
navigate your marketplace, as well as links to additional destinations,
like your social media profiles.

Let's start editing by navigating to "Content → Footer".

The footer has a special left column that contains predetermined
content: your logo, slogan, social media links, and copyright statement.
In addition, you can add 1-4 content columns to the right of the special
column.

### 1. Slogan

The footer has two specific place for "Slogan" as it's a common
convention in footers. Slogan is a one liner describing the essence of
your marketplace.

**Write “The largest online marketplace for bike rentals.”**

### 2. Social media links

We want to link to our awesome social media profile. Let's start by
removing all the existing social media links. Then, add a social media
link by clicking **“+ Add a new social media link”** : Select Facebook
as a platform from the dropdown menu. Add this url as the Link URL:
https://facebook.com/sharetribe

### 3. Copyright

Copyright statement is another common footer convention, so a specific
space has been reserved for it in the footer too. Copyright states that
you reserve the rights to the material on your website.

**Write “© Biketribe"**

### 4. Columns and Content blocks

Content columns contain Content blocks that work a lot like Content
blocks in Pages. However, they have less options. They only have Block
ID and Block text.

You can format block text with
[markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to add links,
bolding, and other rich text.

We're going to repurpose the content columns for the purposes of this
tutorial, as they work quite well for us.

Open the "general" block. You notice that it has three links. Two of
them have a mention of the word "listing". Change this to "bike".

"terms" can stay as is.

Save changes.

### Next: start testing your marketplace – and build your own!

We're done with the setup! It's time to start using your bike
marketplace. Click "View your marketplace" on the top left in the
sidebar and start browsing your site. You can try signing up as a new
user, creating some listings, and then signing up as another user, doing
a search, and making a booking.

Now that you've learned how to build a marketplace with Sharetribe, you
can start building your own! Once you're happy with it, you can publish
it in your own domain and launch it to real users.
