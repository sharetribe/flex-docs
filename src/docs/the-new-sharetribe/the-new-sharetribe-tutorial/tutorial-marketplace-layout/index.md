Layout settings allow you to choose the layout of some of the key pages
in your marketplace by choosing from a set of options. To get started,
you should be in Design -> Layout in your Test environment in Console.

### 1. Search page layout

Search page layout has two options. In "Map view", there's a grid of
images on the left and a map on the right. They work together. This view
works nicely for location-based marketplaces. If your marketplace is not
dealing with location, "Grid view" gives you a standard e-commerce style
view instead: a grid of images, with search filters on the left.
Biketribe is a location-based marketplace, so we'll go with the former
option.

**Choose "Map view"**

### 2. Listing page image layout

Image carousel with thumbnails is a good default for most marketplaces.
However, if the listings in your marketplace are properties with
attractive images, screen-wide cover photos can make the listing page
look more attractive. Our bikes have such good looking images that we're
going to take the latter option.

**Choose "Screen-wide cover photo"**

### 3. Listing thumbnail aspect ratio

Listing thumbnails are cropped versions of the listing image. They are
displayed on many pages: create listing page, listing search, checkout,
and order details. The three options are landscape (width larger than
height), square, and portrait (height larger than width).

Most bike images are probably taken in a landscape orientation and
therefore the thumbnails will look better in the search results with
this option.

**Choose "Landscape (4:3)"**

### Save Changes

Once you're happy with the changes, click "Save changes" to activate
them. If the "Save changes" button is grey, that means the current set
of changes has already been saved.

### Next: landing page

That's it for layout! Next,
[go to Step 3: Modify the landing page](/the-new-sharetribe/tutorial-landing-page/).
