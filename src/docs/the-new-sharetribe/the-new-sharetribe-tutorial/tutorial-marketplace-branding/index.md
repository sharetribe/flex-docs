# What can you configure

Branding settings allow you to change the brand images and the main
color of your marketplace. In Console’s test environment, go to Design →
Branding to start making changes.

## Follow these steps

### 1. Set the main color

Click on the color field. When the dropdown appears, choose “Select
color.” This will allow you to select a color. You can use a color
picker, click a color on the color gradient, or input an RGB coordinate
or a hex value.

In this case, we're going to use RGB coordinates. Choose 101,68,228 for
R,G and B. This should give you the blue brand color of Biketribe.

### 2. Upload the logo

Click on the “Upload an image...” field for the logo. Once there, you
should be able to upload an image from your computer. Download the image
below and use it for your settings.

### 3. Upload the favicon

Favicon is the small square image displayed in the browser tab when
someone is browsing your marketplace. Click on the “Upload an image...”
field for the Favicon. Once you click this, you should be able to upload
an image from your computer. Download the image below and use it for
your settings.

### 4. Upload a background image for login pages

You can add a big background image to your login page, signup page and a
few other authentication-related pages to connect these pages to your
brand. Click on the “Upload an image...” field for the Background image
for login pages. Upload the PNG image below.

### 5. Upload a Social media image

Social media image will be displayed in services like Facebook, Twitter
and LinkedIn when someone shares a link to your marketplace in them.

Click on the “Upload an image...” field for Social media. Use this
image:

### Save Changes

You need to save the changes that you made on this page in order to
activate them. Once you've done that, you can click "View your
marketplace" on the top left of the sidebar. You should notice that the
brand color and brand images of your marketplace have changed.
