Being the marketplace Operator and being able to log in to Console does
not mean that you have an account in your marketplace. To sign up as a
user, you need to follow the same process as all your other users: go to
the marketplace sign-up page.

On the signup page, enter the requested details. These are email, first
name, last name, and password. We recommend you use your real first name
and last name. You can also use the same email that you used to create
your Sharetribe account. A secure password is recommended, but since
this is only your test account, you can also use a simpler,
easier-to-remember, password. Accept the Terms of Service and the
Privacy Policy and click “Sign up.”

You will receive an email in your inbox, click the confirmation link in
the email, and that’s it. You are a bona fide user of the Saunatime
marketplace.

## Optional: update your Profile information

Once logged in (you will be automatically logged in after signing up),
you can go to your “Profile settings” to add a profile picture and a
profile bio. To go to your profile settings, click on your initials
(replaced by your picture once you add one) in the top right corner of
the marketplace page and select: profile settings.

From the Profile settings, you can easily find on the top right the
other two profile-related pages: “Your listings” (which should say “Your
saunas” if you have followed this tutorial step by step) and “Account
settings”. Within “Your listings” you will be able to manage all your
listings, open closed listings, close open listings, edit draft
listings, and more. Within “Acccount settings” you can edit your contact
detail, i.e., phone number, change your password, edit your Payout
details (for selling) and Payment methods (for buying). Ignore the
Payout details and Payment methods for now. We will tackle that process
[when creating a listing](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/pilot-day-guides/creating-your-first-listing).
