The marketplace commission is the easiest way to monetize your
Sharetribe marketplace. It allows you to charge a fee for every money
transaction that happens in your marketplace. A good commission can be
fundamental to keep your marketplace healthy and attract new users. Most
marketplace platforms monetize by charging commissions from the
providers in a transaction that happens in the marketplace.

Ideally, the commission should cover the costs of running your
marketplace, which, for example, includes Stripe’s processing fees and,
eventually, even account for part of your marketplace profit. This means
that to monetize from commissions, it’s essential to facilitate
transactions on the marketplace.

## Provider commission

The provider commission is a fixed or percentage fee that’s taken from
the listing price. It’s paid by the seller, and it goes to the
marketplace.

### Example

Let’s set the provider commission as 10%. If the listing price is
$60, then the seller commission of 10% is used. This means that the buyer pays a total of $60.
The marketplace gets $6, and the seller gets $56.

## Why is it called Provider commission?

There are other types of commission that you could charge in your
marketplace. At the moment, only charging the Provider is supported. You
cannot have any other type of commission.
