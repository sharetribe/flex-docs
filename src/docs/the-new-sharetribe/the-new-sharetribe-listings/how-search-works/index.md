Search is how users find what they are looking for on your marketplace.
It is typically the first thing customers do when visiting your
marketplace, so creating an intuitive experience is fundamental to
building a successful marketplace.

In your marketplace, both anonymous users (users without a login) and
logged in users can search and view listings created by providers on
your marketplace. Only logged in users can initiate transactions on
these listings.

The New Sharetribe offers keyword search, location search, and custom
filters to create the right search experience for your users.

## Keyword or Location search

The initial search on your marketplace is possible with using keyword or
location search.

If you enable
[keyword search](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/the-new-sharetribe/keyword-search/),
your users search for listings by typing text into a search bar.

When
[location search](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/the-new-sharetribe/location-search/)
is enabled, users search for listings by searching for a specific place,
like a country, city, or street. You can also enable keyword filtering
on location based searches if you need both ways of searching.

You can find out more
[here about the search feature settings](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/the-new-sharetribe/listing-search-settings/).

## Search page layout and filters

Your search page (where results from a search appear) can show listings
in map view or grid view.
[You can learn more about the layout options in this article](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/the-new-sharetribe/search-page-layout-options/).

On the search page, users can sort and filter their results. You can
create sort and filter options from the listing fields you ask providers
to fill out.
