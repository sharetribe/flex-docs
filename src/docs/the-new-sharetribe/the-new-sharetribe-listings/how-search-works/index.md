Search is how users find what they are looking for on your marketplace.
It is typically the first thing customers do when visiting your
marketplace, so creating an intuitive experience is fundamental to
building a successful marketplace.

In your marketplace, both anonymous users (users without a login) and
logged in users can search and view listings created by providers on
your marketplace. Only logged in users can initiate transactions on
these listings.

The New Sharetribe offers keyword search, location search, and custom
filters to create the right search experience for your users.

## Keyword or Location search

The initial search on your marketplace is possible with using keyword or
location search.

If you enable
[keyword search](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/the-new-sharetribe/keyword-search/),
your users search for listings by typing text into a search bar.

When
[location search](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/the-new-sharetribe/location-search/)
is enabled, users search for listings by searching for a specific place,
like a country, city, or street. You can also enable keyword filtering
on location based searches if you need both ways of searching.

[here about the search feature settings](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/the-new-sharetribe/listing-search-settings/).

## Search page layout and filters

Your search page (where results from a search appear) can show listings
in map view or grid view.
[You can learn more about the layout options in this article](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/the-new-sharetribe/search-page-layout-options/).

On the search page, users can sort and filter their results. You can
create sort and filter options from the listing fields you ask providers
to fill out.

## FAQ

### How do I enable location and keyword search?

If your marketplace uses the location search, you can choose to display
a keyword filter on your marketplace search page. This filters all
results from the initial location search using keywords. You can enable
location and keyword search from Listing search tab in Console.

### How do I search by users?

If your marketplace search is built around user profiles, as might be
the case in a marketplace for finding and hiring industry experts, then
you should build your listings to capture information about the
individual. You can change your custom filters, Listing types, and
marketplace texts to suit this use case. Searching for user profiles is
not possible without making coding changes to your marketplace.

### How do I search by Listing type?

Your marketplace may have multiple Listing types, enabling different
types of transactions and listings. It is not possible to use Listing
types in a search currently, so filters, keyword, and/or location search
should be used to help buyers find the right listing.

### What happens to listings without availability when using the availability filters?

Before an availability filter is applied, all listings matching the
searched for criteria are returned regardless of Listing type. For
instance, a keyword search for "bike" will return bikes that are
available for purchase and bikes that are available for rental, if both
such listings exist in your marketplace. Once an availability filter is
applied, then only Listings that have an availability plan (i.e.
listings available for bookings) are shown.
