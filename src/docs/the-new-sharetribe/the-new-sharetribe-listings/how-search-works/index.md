  Search is how users find what they are looking for on your
  marketplace. It is typically the first thing customers do when
  visiting your marketplace, so creating an intuitive experience is
  fundamental to building a successful marketplace

The New Sharetribe offers you several tools to help you build the right search
experience for your users.

Note that both anonymous users (users without a login) and logged in
users can search and view listings created by providers on your
marketplace. Only logged in users can initiate transactions on these
listings.

## Keyword or Location search

By default, two types of search are available in your marketplace:
keyword and location search. If you enable
[keyword search](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/the-new-sharetribe/keyword-search/),
your users search for listings by typing text into a search bar. When
[location search](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/the-new-sharetribe/location-search/)
is enabled, users search for listings by searching for a specific place,
like a country, city, or street.

You can find out more
[here about the search feature settings](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/the-new-sharetribe/listing-search-settings/).

## Search page layout and filters

Your search page (where results from a search appear) can show listings
in map view or grid view.
[You can learn more about the layout options in this article](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/the-new-sharetribe/search-page-layout-options/).

On the search page, users can sort and filter their results. You can
create sort and filter options from the listing fields you ask providers
to fill out.

## Can I have both Keyword and Location search enabled?

At the moment it is unfortunately **not possible** to have both search
functions working at the same time by default. However, this is
achievable if you host your own front end application.

## Can I enable user or transaction search (instead of listing's search)?

No. At the moment it is only possible to search listings. But you can
build your marketplace around the User flows or User experieence where
users create listings to display their profiles and manage their
availability.
