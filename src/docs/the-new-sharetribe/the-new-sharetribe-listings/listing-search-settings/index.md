The search feature is enabled by default in all Sharetribe marketplaces.
You can define the type of search to support depending on your user’s
needs. You can also add filtering options to your marketplace, this
include general filter options and specific fields filters.

## Search type

Sharetribe has two different search types or search functions, keyword
and location search. You can enable one or combine them from the Listing
Search page of Console. You can read more about these features and how
they work in these articles:

- [Keyword search](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/the-new-sharetribe/keyword-search/)
- [Location search](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/the-new-sharetribe/location-search/)

## Filters

In the Listing search settings you can also enable filters for default
fields. You can choose to Display a date range filter and Display a
Price filter.
[If you want to understand adding filters for custom fields read here](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/the-new-sharetribe/understanding-filters).

### Date range filter

Enabling this feature, by clicking the checkbox, will display a date
range filter in the search page. This filter allows users to define a
date or a date range to filter with. From the settings you can define
how the filter behaves.

#### Availability mode

You can choose Partial availability or Full availability

- Partial availability: Displays all listings that are available with at
  least some dates within the user’s selected date range, even if they
  are not available for the full range.
- Full availability: Displays listings that are available for the entire
  selected date range. Listings that are only partially available will
  not be displayed.

#### Date range mode

You can choose Daily availability or Nightly availability

- Daily availability: When choosing a date or date range, the start and
  end date can be the same. People could filter for one specific date.
- Nightly availability: When choosing a date range, the start date
  cannot be the same as the end date. People would need to filter for at
  least one night. From one day to the next.

### Price filter

The price filter option allows you to add a filter to the search page.
You can define the minimum and maximum range for the filter. Users can
then filter-in listings with specific price ranges. They can also
filter-out listings that are too cheap or too expensive. Make sure that
the minimum and maximum values make sense for your marketplace,
otherwise, when users use the filter, they might inadvertently filter
out listings that might be good, because of the wrong filter
configuration. Price filters don't define listing price limits.
