Welcome to The New Sharetribe tutorial! In this tutorial, you'll learn
how to build and launch a marketplace website without coding.

In this tutorial, we will be setting up a rental marketplace. However,
we'll also give guidance on what to do if you're building a marketplace
for selling products or services instead.

We will focus exclusively on using the no-code settings of The New
Sharetribe throughout this tutorial. Our step-by-step instructions will
navigate you through the process of configuring your marketplace in
Console. Please note that all work will be carried out in your
marketplace's Test environment.

## What are we building?

In this tutorial, we're going to kick things off with the default theme,
Biketribe, and tweak it into a peer-to-peer marketplace for renting
saunas. We're going to call it "Saunatime." Now, while we're guiding you
with specific steps to build Saunatime, feel free to mix things up a bit
to create your unique marketplace concept instead. Just remember, if you
switch things around, you'll need to keep track of those changes when
following other steps in this tutorial. Along the way, we'll also cover
a few key concepts to help you better understand the process.

of your marketplace and to test the marketplace functionality. At the
end, we'll also explain the steps to take to launch your marketplace
live, in your own domain, and start inviting real users to it.
