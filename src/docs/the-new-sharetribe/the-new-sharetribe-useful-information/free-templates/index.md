Every marketplace business needs Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
agreements. However, these legal documents can be fairly difficult to
write, especially when you're just getting started.

To help you launch your marketplace faster, we've compiled two templates
you can use as a baseline for the agreements between your online
marketplace business and its users.

We've relied on
[TermsFeed's](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=854385&u=3406491&m=65338)
expertise to create these templates and can recommend their service if
you want to create more legal agreements and policies for your online
business. We've even partnered with them to offer you a

## What is not part of the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy templates

The templates cover the most important things to protect your business
and your marketplace members. Still, your documents will likely need
some customization to fit your unique business.

In particular, you should pay attention to:

- Country-specific regulation compliance details. The country you’re
  operating in may have specific rules for online businesses and
  marketplaces. If that’s the case, you should contact your tax office
  or local legal state service to learn more and adjust your terms and
  privacy policy accordingly.
- Industry-specific compliance details. If you operate in an industry
  that has specific rules and regulations, it may be important to take
  them into account in your terms.
- Service fees. If your service fee structure is complex and isn't fully
  detailed during the checkout or on a listing page, you should explain
  it in detail in your terms.
- Refund Policy. Once you have defined your refund policy in detail,
  it's a good idea to add it to your terms.
- Listing fields. If you ask providers for something beyond the general
  listing information when they post a new listing, it's a good idea to
  write it down in your terms.
- Access restriction. If you decide to restrict access to your
  marketplace (based on users’ age, location, background checks, or
  something else), you should list these criteria in your terms.
