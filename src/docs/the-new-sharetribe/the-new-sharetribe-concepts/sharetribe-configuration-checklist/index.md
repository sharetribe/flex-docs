Your starting marketplace app starts with generic content and
configurations in many places. You'll want to modify these texts,
pictures, and configurations to turn the generic marketplace into your
own.

The following checklist provides an overview of every configuration in
the default marketplace that you should review. You will likely need to
change most or all of the defaults, but some of the defaults, like the
transaction process, can be kept if they work for you.

This checklist also provides an opportunity to learn more about the
no-code tools at your disposal.

You can do this by going to your environments, select live, and choose
subscription plan. And now, you're live.
