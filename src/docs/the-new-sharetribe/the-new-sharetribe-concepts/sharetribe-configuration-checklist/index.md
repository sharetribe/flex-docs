Building your marketplace with The New Sharetribe typically starts by
modifying your example marketplace that has some generic assets. Learn
more about what to modify to turn the generic marketplace into one that
reflects your own.

The first step to building your marketplace with The New Sharetribe is
modifying the default configurations and assets that do not apply to
your marketplace. You can modify these with no-code tools from Console.
Console is your operator backend for configuring your marketplace
without code and viewing and managing your marketplace data, like users
or listings.

The following checklist provides an overview of every configuration in
the default marketplace that you should review. You will likely need to
change most or all of the defaults, but some of the defaults, like the
transaction process, can be kept if they work for you.

In any case, the exhaustive checklist provides an opportunity to learn
more about the no-code tools at your disposal.
