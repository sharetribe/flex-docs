Pages add the ability to build, edit, and manage your marketplace’s
content pages directly from Console. Content pages like a Landing page
or About page can now be modified without developer input. Pages’
deployment workflow lets you create and review content changes in
development mode before making them available in your live marketplace.

## What you can do with Pages

Pages lets you create and edit content pages without code in The New Sharetribe. On
your marketplace, content pages are pages featuring content created by
you, the marketplace operator. Landing pages, “About” pages, FAQs or
blog posts are all examples of content pages.

There are various use cases for content pages. The most obvious one is
to provide informational content about how your marketplace works to
your users. In addition, you might use Pages to create alternative
landing pages for various user groups, for search engine optimization
(SEO) or paid advertising purposes, or even create a simple blog.

Any New Sharetribe marketplace starts with 4 default pages: the About page, the
Landing page, the Privacy policy page, and Terms of use page. Pages lets
you edit these default pages, but, with the exception of the About Page,
they cannot be removed. In addition to the default pages, you can add
and edit any number of custom content pages.

## How Pages works

You can use Pages from Console, in "Content -> Pages". You can try it
immediately in the New Sharetribe Test environment, or use it to create your
content after setting up your own marketplace app. Start editing the
default content pages!

Each content page is built using a combination of sections and blocks.
Sections define the different content areas and their layout. Blocks
contain the information presented in a section. Blocks are made up of
multiple different types of content, like texts, Youtube videos or
images.

The content you create displays in your marketplace frontend. It is laid
out using the default New Sharetribe design. If you want your content to follow a
different design, a developer can make the necessary modifications. A
future release will also allow developers to add more types of sections
and blocks, which will make it possible to create a wider variety of
content pages.

While your marketplace is in development, use Pages in the Test
environment to build out your content.

When your marketplace is launched and you have a Live environment,
continue to use the Test environment to make changes to your published
marketplace content and preview how they look in your Test site. When
ready, you copy finished changes from your Test environment to your Live
environment and live marketplace application.
