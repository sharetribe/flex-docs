  The landing page is likely to be the first impression for many of your
  users. This page plays a crucial role in persuading new visitors to
  delve further into your marketplace, so it needs to be visually
  appealing and inviting.

To customize the landing page and construct additional pages, we'll take
advantage of Sharetribe's built-in Content Management System, Pages.
With Pages, you can edit your content pages like "About us", "How it
works", "Terms of use", and so on, or even create a simple blog. In this
tutorial, we will only work on your Landing page.

All your content pages can be modified under **Build → Content →
Pages**. Once in Pages, Go to your landing page card and click on
**“Edit content.”** ![Edit content image](./editcontent.png)

_Optional Tip: Before editing the content, click **“View page,”** which
will open the landing page on a separate tab. You can use this tab’s
refresh option in your browser and see changes after saving each
section._

Within the landing page edit page, you will encounter several sections.
You can add and remove sections according to your unique needs. In this
tutorial, we'll only make a few quick modifications to the existing
sections to build a landing page for our sauna marketplace with a
minimum amount of work.

### 1. “hero” section

The first section of a landing page is typically called "Hero". It often
includes your main message, with the most important "call-to-action" (an
invite for a user to take a specific action by clicking a button, etc).
We'll keep this section, but it should be talking about saunas, not
about bikes.

There are several settings we can keep intact.

- Don’t change Section ID. Don’t change the Section template selection
  (leave it as “Features”)
- Leave the section title and Section description empty. You will affect
  the look of this section through the section Block.
- Keep the default “No call to action” option.

The settings should look like this: ![Hero section](./herosection.png)

We do want to change the background image though.

- In the Section appearance section choose “Custom” And add this image:
  ![custom settings image](./customsetting.png)

Then, let's change the text content. The hero section already has a
content block called "hero-block". Make the following changes:

- Replace the Image file for the file below (it is a transparent PNG
  file). Leave the Aspect ratio and Image alt text as they are.
  [Download the transparent image here](/tutorial-assets/tns/transparent-image.png)
- Replace the Block title content for: “Welcome to Saunatime” and select
  Page title (H1) as the Block title size.
- Replace the Block text content for: write “The marketplace for all
  sauna bookings and rentals. From electric saunas to smoke and wood
  saunas, you'll find the best possible saunas you can in Finland and at
  the most affordable prices. Book a hot night or rent yours out!”
- Change the Internal link text to “Browse saunas in Helsinki.” Leave
  all other call-to-action settings intact.

Save changes and check the current view on the “view page” tab you
opened earlier. ![Hero section image](./welcomesaunatime.png)

### 2. “locations” section

The next section, locations, can be used to link directly to locations
where you have or expect to have, the most listings. By default, the
section already contains some locations. We will use the pre-set
locations for this tutorial.

We'll only make a few minor changes to the text content:

- Change the Section Title to: “Find a Sauna Anywhere”.
- Change the section description to “Find the best saunas at the tap of
  a button, anywhere in Finland.”

There's no need to change the Section call to action or the Section
appearance

Within the Content blocks, you will see there are 6 cities pre-set.
Within each city’s Content Block open the Block and alter the Block
text, and only the Block text. Replace the word “bikes” with “saunas”.

### 3. “how-it-works” section

Open the “how-it-works-for-customers” section. Change the section ID to
“how-it-works”. Replace the word “Bike” for the word “Sauna” in ever
text of the section. You need to change it in:

- Section title
- Section description
- Content blocks:
- Block titles
- Block texts

In Block 3 of the section, **“how-it-works-step-3”**, Change the Block
title for **“3. Start enjoying!”** and the Block text for: **“Use
Saunatime’s messaging system to iron out the details of the visit, and
prepare for a relaxing experience!”**

### 4. Other sections

Remove all other sections from the Page editor.

Remember to “Save changes”

### 5. SEO & Social

At the top of the page editor, there's a tab "SEO & Social". It allows
you to set titles and descriptions for your page for search engines and
social media sites.

Add the following content:

- Page title: Saunatime - Book saunas everywhere Page description: The
  largest online community for to find and rent a sauna.
- Page title for social media: Book saunas everywhere
- Page description for social media: The largest online community for to
  find and rent a sauna.
- Social media image: Add the following image

![Book saunas everywhere](./seoandsocial.png)

Save changes.

### 6. Other static Pages

By default, your marketplace includes three other static content pages
that you should change before you launch: "About", "Privacy Policy", and
"Terms of Service". "About" is an optional page you can remove if you
don't need it. "Privatey Policy" and "Terms of Service" are mandatory to
have. Sharetribe provides a template for both pages. In addition to
these, you can add any number of other content pages.

We won't go through these pages in this tutorial. Now that you know how
to edit your landing page, you can use the same editor for the other
pages.

### Next: listing type

That's it for landing page! Next, it's time to start configuring how
listings in your marketplace work.
