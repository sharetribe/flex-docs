If you want to verify your marketplace using Google Search Console, you can do it by adding the content of Google's verification tag in Console. 

## Add your website to Google Search Console

1. Log in to Google Search Console account with your Google account at [https://search.google.com/search-console/about](https://search.google.com/search-console/about)
1. Add a new Property of type "URL prefix"
1. Follow the instructions to configure your website
1. When asked to verify the ownership, choose chose "HTML tag" as the verification method
1. From the "google-site-verification" meta tag that is displayed, copy only the part in "content", not the whole tag: it looks something like this: "qG1ql1i1ej7C50dqpvx4lEjsyCfKqbOyfMBLjCfkj1u"
 

## Add the content of the Google Search Console verification tag to your marketplace in Console

1. Log in to Console
