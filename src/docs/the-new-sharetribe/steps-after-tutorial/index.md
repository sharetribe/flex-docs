You can now follow the tutorial instructions or use what you learned
from it to set up your own rental marketplace according to your needs.

Once you are ready to subscribe and go live, you can transfer your
setting to your live environment. Besides transferring your settings you
would need to setup keys and accounts specific to a live marketplace.

You can follow the instructions on [how to go live here](Link to a how
to go live article).

If you want to customize your marketplace further with development, you
can continue along [the technical tutorial](LINK TO THE TECHNICAL
