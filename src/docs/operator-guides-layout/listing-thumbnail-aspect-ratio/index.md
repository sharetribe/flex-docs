These images give the first impression of your offering to your prospective buyers, you should configure aspect ratios that best represent the actual offerings on your marketplace. For instance, landscape ratio photos can be great to display house photos or bicycles, but might work poorly for books or clothing.  

The images that are used to create the thumbnails are the same that the provider uploads in the listing creation form. The maximum listing size is 20 MB and 3072 x 3072 pixels. 

The listing thumbnails can have a portrait, landscape, or square ratio.

Landscape: For the landscape thumbnail, the ideal image aspect ratio should be 4:3, for example, 1350 x 1080 pixels. This means that the image width should be larger than the height. 
Portrait: For the portrait thumbnail, the ideal image aspect ratio should be 3:4, for example, 1080 x 1350 pixels. This means that the image height should be larger than the width. 
Square: For the square thumbnail, the ideal image aspect ratio should be 4:4, for example, 1080 x 1080 pixels. This means that the image height and width should be equal. 

The recommended listing image file type is jpg or png. For more information on how to ensure the best quality photos on your marketplace, check out this article.
